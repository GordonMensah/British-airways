1850,1850,0.024,0.901,0.076,0.8708,Not    I have flow on BA several times since the airline started nonstop service between Austin TX and London Heathrow Every year the service gets worse I brought a tape measure with me to see how far apart the seats are in the economy section 25½ inches BA has removed bathrooms in order to squeeze a few more rows of seats onto the aircraft Thankfully Im not a big person and was able to squeeze into my seat without being too uncomfortable When BA first started flying out of Austin the food was great Now when I arrive at Heathrow I get real food and take it on the plane with me I dont know where or who makes BAs food but it is not eatable If BA did not have a direct flight from my hometown to London I would fly with a different airline When we checked into Heathrow the line was extremely long and only one person was checking people in It took nearly an hour to get to the counter I understand airlines are making record profits and need to make up lost revenue from the pandemic but I think BA has gone too far and has little concern for customer service in pursuit of profits,Extremely Positive
2207,2207,0.03,0.876,0.094,0.882,Not   This review is for LHRSYDLHR BA015 and BA016 Business class had a 121 configuration on 777 giving space privacy and easy aisle access Seat reclines into comfortable flat bed Good quality pillow and duvet Privacy with sliding door Good storage space around the seat and charging point Flights on time  no delays Gluten free meals were very poor in quality and presentation Warm processed meat between two bland slices of GF bread apparently is a business class breakfast On two sectors the main course no choice offered was bland fish which was served in a single small tray covered with foil  in business class Condensation had formed as the dish was reheated probably from chilled so the offering was sitting in a weak watery liquid One crew member appeared genuinely apologetic as they meekly served one meal Do BA also serve the same GF offering in economy economy plus and first on a long haul flight My advice if GF  take your own food or dine in the lounge if you are in the care of BA for 24 hours My travelling companion had very good regular meals or so they told me with a choice of main course on the same flights Crew gave the impression that they were doing a job covering the basics and rather than welcoming and engaging Usual hospitality industry waffle about service but little of substance delivered,Extremely Positive
1013,1013,0.061,0.813,0.126,0.9856, Check in was chaotic and badly organised Even though there were two desks one for premium and one economy there ended up being just one queue in front of the premium check in even though most passengers in it were economy That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers unnecessarily badly organised the staff in charge should be retrained Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines and it is actually quite good overall Nice layout and seating options reasonable food and drink options and an outdoor terrace which is really nice Boarding was very well organised although quite slow to get everyone on board but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards although as previously commented are really not very good overall the meal service was disappointing As is normal BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option  when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I’ve ever had in any cabin class rolling some mush similar consistency to mashed potato into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage BA you need to improve the meal options make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals  then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out Whilst I hadn’t planned on using it the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use Overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient I used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me,Extremely Positive
3355,3355,0.05,0.784,0.165,0.9879,  I am a frequent flyer with BA and have been for the last 15 years Having noted the ratings given frankly I cannot understand how BA scores three stars for most aspects of its service In a nutshell BA has placed profit margins over passenger appreciation This fact was hammered home on my return leg which was not in Club Europe Quite alarmingly BA appears to place profit over passenger safety by extending its Business Class seating up to and beyond emergency exit rows and then failing to ensure those seated in exit rows have the physical capacity to actually open the door incase of an emergency I was not at all reassured to see an elderly and slightly built woman seated with the responsibility of opening the overwing exit should the need have arisen Shorthaul business Club Europe is simply a joke and only useful for gaining valuable tier points for loungepreboarding benefits While cabin crew service is excellent the lack of space and reduction in refreshment choices etc places them a million airmiles behind competing airlines such as Qatar Turkish or Emirates who understand the true definition of customer appreciation and hospitality BA has consistently eroded the value of their Executive Club and seems to be of the impression that recent changes in obtaining avios points during the booking process benefit passengers  really I want to support BA and did enjoy flying with them up to the point when they started penny pinching and became more deserving of the name Budget Airways The attached photos taking during my most recent itinerary highlight the difference in customer careappreciation between British Airways and another airline used in this trip Both flights were around 4 hours in duration on the same day Guess which one is shows BAs inflight offering,Extremely Positive
2204,2204,0.05,0.864,0.086,0.7708, For the price paid bought during a sale it was a decent experience although the club class business class seats offer no more legroom than economy class using shorthaul fleet on a 4 hour flight Fast track through security was not honoured The lounge at Istanbul airport was overcrowded as it is also open to the public who can pay for usage causing a long queue for entry  which was badly organised Boarding was smooth cabin crew were friendly but their service was hitandmiss Eg Some people got a “welcome” and some didn’t Half of the cabin was automatically offered coffee after dinner but not the other half However drinks were replenished generously and regularly and the meal was good with a choice of three mains from the menu,Extremely Positive
1010,1010,0.071,0.697,0.231,0.969,This was our first flight with British Airways in over 13 years and as usual I couldn’t fault them As we were connecting we had little interaction with ground staff  staff in the lounge were friendly and helpful Cabin crew on the flight were great  very welcoming and friendly Our meals were delicious  no shortage of drinks being offered The seats were economy seats with the middle row blocked off and some recline We arrived into Stockholm a little early through a snow shower which was a nice welcome back to Stockholm Bags checked in at JFK were delivered safely within 20 mins of arriving,Extremely Positive
1009,1009,0.064,0.845,0.091,0.8861,Not    Overall not bad Staff look tired and overworked trying their best Weird seats I was in 21G going and 21D going home The buttons to press for the seat recline are so stiff I had to get help on both flights to get them to work There is another button also very stiff to bring the “leg rest” out This is an awkward thing which doesn’t come up far enough to be of any use at all for your legs but just obstructs your feet really Again I had to get help to activate the very stiff buttons At one point the lady next to me was pressing the buttons for me while I tried to recline sit up or put the “leg rest” back We gave up and called the flight attendant who also had trouble BA please give this some maintenance Food only one out of three menu choices available by the time it got to me in Premium Ec It was pasta and was not too bad A Christmas Turkey Dinner was offered but why not load more if it is so popular that it is not available 10 minutes into the meal service “Breakfast” was an unidentified soggy pastry thing in a cardboard tube It was disgusting same offered on return journey A cold pastry and fruit would be so much nicer The tea and coffee was hot at least Overall I would say Air Canada provides a much superior Premium Ec service than BA I won’t choose BA again,Extremely Positive

1017,1017,0.047,0.787,0.166,0.9971,Much better experience this time around Flew CPT to LHR on a new A350 Checkin was efficient I used the Bidvest lounge at CPT as it is better than BAs lounge Boarding was speedy The new business class club suites are very good Slightly irritating to be directed to the wrong seat 1A instead of 1K which meant that after settling in the passenger in 1A showed up We arranged a seat switch Second time in a row it has happened Why cant BA staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right Captains announcement was short and on point Welcome drink was served at the correct temperature ie cold first time ever for me  previously BA has always served the welcome champagne warm IFE system was good  everything worked as it should Felt slightly cheap that business class passengers have to pay for wifi I did not bother Cocktail was good The nuts came on a cheap plastic tray which was naff  other airlines bring out something classier A female flight attendant came to take my order and I asked for Rooibas panacotta and the chicken breast She repeated back to me so you want a P and a C It was such a bizarre thing to say that I misheard I thought she said so you want beef and sea Confusion reigned until she explained to me she had a checklist of passenger orders and they abbreviate to first letters so she was saying P for panacotta and C for chicken But how bizarre to repeat back an order to a passenger in code Why not just say so to confirm panacotta to start and chicken as your main dish like every other restaurant  airline does in the world The internal coding of food ordering is exactly that  internal She even looked irritated at me that I did not understand her jargon first time The food when it came was excellent Much much better than recent flights I read somewhere that BA changed caterer If so it shows The panacotta was superb as was the chicken  good restaurant quality The wine was OK to good but definitely not good to excellent I feel that while the food has got better in BA business class the wines have got worse Certainly compared to Air France which I have also flown recently The wine was brought out on time not afer I finished eating as it was lass time I flew BA business Cheese was also good and not teeth crackingly cold as last time I had a good nights sleep Plenty of snacks out if you wanted them and they did not run out Breakfast was excellent and the coffee was hot previously it has been lukewarm So all in all a vastly improved service offering The staff seemed rushed off their feet  it would not hurt to have an extra flight attendant to look after so many business class seats Overall summary vastly improved passenger proposition It would be 1010 but I deduct a point for showing me to the wrong seat and another point for the bizarre interaction with the female flight attendant who repeated my food order back to me using internal jargon codes,Extremely Positive

2108,2108,0.069,0.803,0.128,0.9737,Absolutely pathetic business class product BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market With old outdated 8 across seating  no I did not make a typing mistake  you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats BA like most other Europeanbased airlines does not have a factual IntraEuropean business class product even though they promote  sell business class IntraEurope flights feature the same 33 seating throughout the aircraft  the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in business class  passengers get a meal  drinks but this does not justify the higher cost BAs TransAtlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the narrow 8 across seating The biggest surprise on both the LISLHR  LHRIAH flights was that BA has in fact substantially improved their food quality Shocking Unfortunately it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown The entertainment  system  small screens  my laptop screen is twice the size  is like an airline offering 2 decades ago The flight crew was pleasant  perfunctory which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore Emirates Qatar Etihad EVA ANA Japan Air New Zealand Qantas or many others BA can compete with USbased airlines like Delta American  United which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a highquality business class product One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class Several hundred US dollars for TransAtlantic flights Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain,Extremely Positive

722,722,0.0,0.761,0.239,0.9516, The flight took off a little late due to Heathrow congestion but still landed on schedule Boarding was smooth and the onboard service was efficient A small snack was served for free with a bottle of water additional items were available for purchase The cabin and toilets were very clean Overall an unremarkable flight but in a good way,Extremely Positive
721,721,0.086,0.689,0.225,0.9977,     The check in area for premium classes at Gatwick is very nice and there was no queue when I arrived so I was able to drop my bag very quickly Premium security at Gatwick is fine The flight was delayed due to NATS issues but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this The lounge is nicevand it’ very comfortable There was an excellent range of food and drinks All the drinks you would expect Food wise there were sandwiches soup pasta salads fruit Spanish stew as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy It was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options Boarding was pretty slow although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first As has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on ba Europe business is pretty poor but in line with other European carriers sadly That being said the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good The on board catering was of excellent quality I was lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey but several people sat near me weren’t as lucky I do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal  Or failing that allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat Whilst I fully support the desire to minimise waste both food and cost people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option Unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was The cabin crew were  very nice friendly and professional if a little slow but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience I had The ground service at Gran Canaria was pretty poor priority bags clearly meant nothing 95 of bags coming out were not priority mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers Overall though it was a very nice flight and having paid for it using avios and £1 I cannot complain at all,Extremely Positive
720,720,0.0,0.715,0.285,0.9768,     Credit to BA  Flew to Singapore recently and also back from Doha to London and both experiences were great Service was fantastic as was the quality of the food entertainment and was left feeling BA have got it together after a few previous below average experiences You definitely notice the difference with the staff on BA  Far more approachable and outgoing compared to the cold and corporate middle eastern airline crews Nice one BA for 2 great flights,Extremely Positive
719,719,0.049,0.782,0.168,0.8462, BA A380s are showing their age hopefully they will update the interiors soon because it was a let down especially when the flight lasts 11 hours Cabin crew were good and helpful Dinner was ok but the breakfast was grim On board entertainment was not the latest and seat back USB points didnt work The only upside of BA is that it is only 1 of 2 airlines who fly this route directly and their pricing reflects this if youre prepared to lay over then there are better airlines out there,Extremely Positive
717,717,0.047,0.787,0.166,0.9971,Much better experience this time around Flew CPT to LHR on a new A350 Checkin was efficient I used the Bidvest lounge at CPT as it is better than BAs lounge Boarding was speedy The new business class club suites are very good Slightly irritating to be directed to the wrong seat 1A instead of 1K which meant that after settling in the passenger in 1A showed up We arranged a seat switch Second time in a row it has happened Why cant BA staff memorise which side of the plane is which and get it right Captains announcement was short and on point Welcome drink was served at the correct temperature ie cold first time ever for me  previously BA has always served the welcome champagne warm IFE system was good  everything worked as it should Felt slightly cheap that business class passengers have to pay for wifi I did not bother Cocktail was good The nuts came on a cheap plastic tray which was naff  other airlines bring out something classier A female flight attendant came to take my order and I asked for Rooibas panacotta and the chicken breast She repeated back to me so you want a P and a C It was such a bizarre thing to say that I misheard I thought she said so you want beef and sea Confusion reigned until she explained to me she had a checklist of passenger orders and they abbreviate to first letters so she was saying P for panacotta and C for chicken But how bizarre to repeat back an order to a passenger in code Why not just say so to confirm panacotta to start and chicken as your main dish like every other restaurant  airline does in the world The internal coding of food ordering is exactly that  internal She even looked irritated at me that I did not understand her jargon first time The food when it came was excellent Much much better than recent flights I read somewhere that BA changed caterer If so it shows The panacotta was superb as was the chicken  good restaurant quality The wine was OK to good but definitely not good to excellent I feel that while the food has got better in BA business class the wines have got worse Certainly compared to Air France which I have also flown recently The wine was brought out on time not afer I finished eating as it was lass time I flew BA business Cheese was also good and not teeth crackingly cold as last time I had a good nights sleep Plenty of snacks out if you wanted them and they did not run out Breakfast was excellent and the coffee was hot previously it has been lukewarm So all in all a vastly improved service offering The staff seemed rushed off their feet  it would not hurt to have an extra flight attendant to look after so many business class seats Overall summary vastly improved passenger proposition It would be 1010 but I deduct a point for showing me to the wrong seat and another point for the bizarre interaction with the female flight attendant who repeated my food order back to me using internal jargon codes,Extremely Positive

713,713,0.061,0.813,0.126,0.9856, Check in was chaotic and badly organised Even though there were two desks one for premium and one economy there ended up being just one queue in front of the premium check in even though most passengers in it were economy That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers unnecessarily badly organised the staff in charge should be retrained Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines and it is actually quite good overall Nice layout and seating options reasonable food and drink options and an outdoor terrace which is really nice Boarding was very well organised although quite slow to get everyone on board but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards although as previously commented are really not very good overall the meal service was disappointing As is normal BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option  when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I’ve ever had in any cabin class rolling some mush similar consistency to mashed potato into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage BA you need to improve the meal options make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals  then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out Whilst I hadn’t planned on using it the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use Overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient I used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me,Extremely Positive

2355,2355,0.05,0.784,0.165,0.9879,  I am a frequent flyer with BA and have been for the last 15 years Having noted the ratings given frankly I cannot understand how BA scores three stars for most aspects of its service In a nutshell BA has placed profit margins over passenger appreciation This fact was hammered home on my return leg which was not in Club Europe Quite alarmingly BA appears to place profit over passenger safety by extending its Business Class seating up to and beyond emergency exit rows and then failing to ensure those seated in exit rows have the physical capacity to actually open the door incase of an emergency I was not at all reassured to see an elderly and slightly built woman seated with the responsibility of opening the overwing exit should the need have arisen Shorthaul business Club Europe is simply a joke and only useful for gaining valuable tier points for loungepreboarding benefits While cabin crew service is excellent the lack of space and reduction in refreshment choices etc places them a million airmiles behind competing airlines such as Qatar Turkish or Emirates who understand the true definition of customer appreciation and hospitality BA has consistently eroded the value of their Executive Club and seems to be of the impression that recent changes in obtaining avios points during the booking process benefit passengers  really I want to support BA and did enjoy flying with them up to the point when they started penny pinching and became more deserving of the name Budget Airways The attached photos taking during my most recent itinerary highlight the difference in customer careappreciation between British Airways and another airline used in this trip Both flights were around 4 hours in duration on the same day Guess which one is shows BAs inflight offering,Extremely Positive
710,710,0.071,0.697,0.231,0.969,This was our first flight with British Airways in over 13 years and as usual I couldn’t fault them As we were connecting we had little interaction with ground staff  staff in the lounge were friendly and helpful Cabin crew on the flight were great  very welcoming and friendly Our meals were delicious  no shortage of drinks being offered The seats were economy seats with the middle row blocked off and some recline We arrived into Stockholm a little early through a snow shower which was a nice welcome back to Stockholm Bags checked in at JFK were delivered safely within 20 mins of arriving,Extremely Positive

708,708,0.069,0.803,0.128,0.9737,Absolutely pathetic business class product BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market With old outdated 8 across seating  no I did not make a typing mistake  you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats BA like most other Europeanbased airlines does not have a factual IntraEuropean business class product even though they promote  sell business class IntraEurope flights feature the same 33 seating throughout the aircraft  the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in business class  passengers get a meal  drinks but this does not justify the higher cost BAs TransAtlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the narrow 8 across seating The biggest surprise on both the LISLHR  LHRIAH flights was that BA has in fact substantially improved their food quality Shocking Unfortunately it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown The entertainment  system  small screens  my laptop screen is twice the size  is like an airline offering 2 decades ago The flight crew was pleasant  perfunctory which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore Emirates Qatar Etihad EVA ANA Japan Air New Zealand Qantas or many others BA can compete with USbased airlines like Delta American  United which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a highquality business class product One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class Several hundred US dollars for TransAtlantic flights Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain,Extremely Positive

2921,2921,0.086,0.689,0.225,0.9977,     The check in area for premium classes at Gatwick is very nice and there was no queue when I arrived so I was able to drop my bag very quickly Premium security at Gatwick is fine The flight was delayed due to NATS issues but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this The lounge is nicevand it’ very comfortable There was an excellent range of food and drinks All the drinks you would expect Food wise there were sandwiches soup pasta salads fruit Spanish stew as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy It was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options Boarding was pretty slow although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first As has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on ba Europe business is pretty poor but in line with other European carriers sadly That being said the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good The on board catering was of excellent quality I was lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey but several people sat near me weren’t as lucky I do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal  Or failing that allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat Whilst I fully support the desire to minimise waste both food and cost people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option Unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was The cabin crew were  very nice friendly and professional if a little slow but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience I had The ground service at Gran Canaria was pretty poor priority bags clearly meant nothing 95 of bags coming out were not priority mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers Overall though it was a very nice flight and having paid for it using avios and £1 I cannot complain at all,Extremely Positive

3055,3055,0.05,0.784,0.165,0.9879,  I am a frequent flyer with BA and have been for the last 15 years Having noted the ratings given frankly I cannot understand how BA scores three stars for most aspects of its service In a nutshell BA has placed profit margins over passenger appreciation This fact was hammered home on my return leg which was not in Club Europe Quite alarmingly BA appears to place profit over passenger safety by extending its Business Class seating up to and beyond emergency exit rows and then failing to ensure those seated in exit rows have the physical capacity to actually open the door incase of an emergency I was not at all reassured to see an elderly and slightly built woman seated with the responsibility of opening the overwing exit should the need have arisen Shorthaul business Club Europe is simply a joke and only useful for gaining valuable tier points for loungepreboarding benefits While cabin crew service is excellent the lack of space and reduction in refreshment choices etc places them a million airmiles behind competing airlines such as Qatar Turkish or Emirates who understand the true definition of customer appreciation and hospitality BA has consistently eroded the value of their Executive Club and seems to be of the impression that recent changes in obtaining avios points during the booking process benefit passengers  really I want to support BA and did enjoy flying with them up to the point when they started penny pinching and became more deserving of the name Budget Airways The attached photos taking during my most recent itinerary highlight the difference in customer careappreciation between British Airways and another airline used in this trip Both flights were around 4 hours in duration on the same day Guess which one is shows BAs inflight offering,Extremely Positive

1613,1613,0.061,0.813,0.126,0.9856, Check in was chaotic and badly organised Even though there were two desks one for premium and one economy there ended up being just one queue in front of the premium check in even though most passengers in it were economy That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers unnecessarily badly organised the staff in charge should be retrained Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines and it is actually quite good overall Nice layout and seating options reasonable food and drink options and an outdoor terrace which is really nice Boarding was very well organised although quite slow to get everyone on board but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards although as previously commented are really not very good overall the meal service was disappointing As is normal BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option  when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I’ve ever had in any cabin class rolling some mush similar consistency to mashed potato into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage BA you need to improve the meal options make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals  then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out Whilst I hadn’t planned on using it the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use Overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient I used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me,Extremely Positive

1655,1655,0.05,0.784,0.165,0.9879,  I am a frequent flyer with BA and have been for the last 15 years Having noted the ratings given frankly I cannot understand how BA scores three stars for most aspects of its service In a nutshell BA has placed profit margins over passenger appreciation This fact was hammered home on my return leg which was not in Club Europe Quite alarmingly BA appears to place profit over passenger safety by extending its Business Class seating up to and beyond emergency exit rows and then failing to ensure those seated in exit rows have the physical capacity to actually open the door incase of an emergency I was not at all reassured to see an elderly and slightly built woman seated with the responsibility of opening the overwing exit should the need have arisen Shorthaul business Club Europe is simply a joke and only useful for gaining valuable tier points for loungepreboarding benefits While cabin crew service is excellent the lack of space and reduction in refreshment choices etc places them a million airmiles behind competing airlines such as Qatar Turkish or Emirates who understand the true definition of customer appreciation and hospitality BA has consistently eroded the value of their Executive Club and seems to be of the impression that recent changes in obtaining avios points during the booking process benefit passengers  really I want to support BA and did enjoy flying with them up to the point when they started penny pinching and became more deserving of the name Budget Airways The attached photos taking during my most recent itinerary highlight the difference in customer careappreciation between British Airways and another airline used in this trip Both flights were around 4 hours in duration on the same day Guess which one is shows BAs inflight offering,Extremely Positive

1708,1708,0.069,0.803,0.128,0.9737,Absolutely pathetic business class product BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market With old outdated 8 across seating  no I did not make a typing mistake  you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats BA like most other Europeanbased airlines does not have a factual IntraEuropean business class product even though they promote  sell business class IntraEurope flights feature the same 33 seating throughout the aircraft  the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in business class  passengers get a meal  drinks but this does not justify the higher cost BAs TransAtlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the narrow 8 across seating The biggest surprise on both the LISLHR  LHRIAH flights was that BA has in fact substantially improved their food quality Shocking Unfortunately it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown The entertainment  system  small screens  my laptop screen is twice the size  is like an airline offering 2 decades ago The flight crew was pleasant  perfunctory which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore Emirates Qatar Etihad EVA ANA Japan Air New Zealand Qantas or many others BA can compete with USbased airlines like Delta American  United which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a highquality business class product One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class Several hundred US dollars for TransAtlantic flights Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain,Extremely Positive

1413,1413,0.061,0.813,0.126,0.9856, Check in was chaotic and badly organised Even though there were two desks one for premium and one economy there ended up being just one queue in front of the premium check in even though most passengers in it were economy That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers unnecessarily badly organised the staff in charge should be retrained Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines and it is actually quite good overall Nice layout and seating options reasonable food and drink options and an outdoor terrace which is really nice Boarding was very well organised although quite slow to get everyone on board but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards although as previously commented are really not very good overall the meal service was disappointing As is normal BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option  when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I’ve ever had in any cabin class rolling some mush similar consistency to mashed potato into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage BA you need to improve the meal options make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals  then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out Whilst I hadn’t planned on using it the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use Overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient I used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me,Extremely Positive
1363,1363,0.0,0.67,0.33,0.9939,  Excellent service levels proactive crew and superb food and beverages I found all aspects of the service to be superior to BA business class even the new BA Club Suites First Class felt exclusive the dedicated crew were clearly used to working the premium cabin enjoying their work were proactive friendly very respectful and the food and beverage offering a considerable step up from business class The seat with sliding double doors was spacious well designed and very comfortable  British Airways offered a solid First Class service from Concorde Lounge to boarding which was actually by group number for a change to the very warm and genuine welcome on boarding A consistent solid comfortable service from start to finish and if the price was right I would not hesitate to book First Class with British Airways again,Extremely Positive

2010,2010,0.071,0.697,0.231,0.969,This was our first flight with British Airways in over 13 years and as usual I couldn’t fault them As we were connecting we had little interaction with ground staff  staff in the lounge were friendly and helpful Cabin crew on the flight were great  very welcoming and friendly Our meals were delicious  no shortage of drinks being offered The seats were economy seats with the middle row blocked off and some recline We arrived into Stockholm a little early through a snow shower which was a nice welcome back to Stockholm Bags checked in at JFK were delivered safely within 20 mins of arriving,Extremely Positive

1355,1355,0.05,0.784,0.165,0.9879,  I am a frequent flyer with BA and have been for the last 15 years Having noted the ratings given frankly I cannot understand how BA scores three stars for most aspects of its service In a nutshell BA has placed profit margins over passenger appreciation This fact was hammered home on my return leg which was not in Club Europe Quite alarmingly BA appears to place profit over passenger safety by extending its Business Class seating up to and beyond emergency exit rows and then failing to ensure those seated in exit rows have the physical capacity to actually open the door incase of an emergency I was not at all reassured to see an elderly and slightly built woman seated with the responsibility of opening the overwing exit should the need have arisen Shorthaul business Club Europe is simply a joke and only useful for gaining valuable tier points for loungepreboarding benefits While cabin crew service is excellent the lack of space and reduction in refreshment choices etc places them a million airmiles behind competing airlines such as Qatar Turkish or Emirates who understand the true definition of customer appreciation and hospitality BA has consistently eroded the value of their Executive Club and seems to be of the impression that recent changes in obtaining avios points during the booking process benefit passengers  really I want to support BA and did enjoy flying with them up to the point when they started penny pinching and became more deserving of the name Budget Airways The attached photos taking during my most recent itinerary highlight the difference in customer careappreciation between British Airways and another airline used in this trip Both flights were around 4 hours in duration on the same day Guess which one is shows BAs inflight offering,Extremely Positive

3021,3021,0.086,0.689,0.225,0.9977,     The check in area for premium classes at Gatwick is very nice and there was no queue when I arrived so I was able to drop my bag very quickly Premium security at Gatwick is fine The flight was delayed due to NATS issues but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this The lounge is nicevand it’ very comfortable There was an excellent range of food and drinks All the drinks you would expect Food wise there were sandwiches soup pasta salads fruit Spanish stew as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy It was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options Boarding was pretty slow although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first As has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on ba Europe business is pretty poor but in line with other European carriers sadly That being said the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good The on board catering was of excellent quality I was lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey but several people sat near me weren’t as lucky I do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal  Or failing that allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat Whilst I fully support the desire to minimise waste both food and cost people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option Unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was The cabin crew were  very nice friendly and professional if a little slow but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience I had The ground service at Gran Canaria was pretty poor priority bags clearly meant nothing 95 of bags coming out were not priority mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers Overall though it was a very nice flight and having paid for it using avios and £1 I cannot complain at all,Extremely Positive

3219,3219,0.049,0.782,0.168,0.8462, BA A380s are showing their age hopefully they will update the interiors soon because it was a let down especially when the flight lasts 11 hours Cabin crew were good and helpful Dinner was ok but the breakfast was grim On board entertainment was not the latest and seat back USB points didnt work The only upside of BA is that it is only 1 of 2 airlines who fly this route directly and their pricing reflects this if youre prepared to lay over then there are better airlines out there,Extremely Positive
3220,3220,0.0,0.715,0.285,0.9768,     Credit to BA  Flew to Singapore recently and also back from Doha to London and both experiences were great Service was fantastic as was the quality of the food entertainment and was left feeling BA have got it together after a few previous below average experiences You definitely notice the difference with the staff on BA  Far more approachable and outgoing compared to the cold and corporate middle eastern airline crews Nice one BA for 2 great flights,Extremely Positive

1408,1408,0.069,0.803,0.128,0.9737,Absolutely pathetic business class product BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market With old outdated 8 across seating  no I did not make a typing mistake  you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats BA like most other Europeanbased airlines does not have a factual IntraEuropean business class product even though they promote  sell business class IntraEurope flights feature the same 33 seating throughout the aircraft  the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in business class  passengers get a meal  drinks but this does not justify the higher cost BAs TransAtlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the narrow 8 across seating The biggest surprise on both the LISLHR  LHRIAH flights was that BA has in fact substantially improved their food quality Shocking Unfortunately it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown The entertainment  system  small screens  my laptop screen is twice the size  is like an airline offering 2 decades ago The flight crew was pleasant  perfunctory which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore Emirates Qatar Etihad EVA ANA Japan Air New Zealand Qantas or many others BA can compete with USbased airlines like Delta American  United which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a highquality business class product One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class Several hundred US dollars for TransAtlantic flights Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain,Extremely Positive

308,308,0.069,0.803,0.128,0.9737,Absolutely pathetic business class product BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market With old outdated 8 across seating  no I did not make a typing mistake  you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats BA like most other Europeanbased airlines does not have a factual IntraEuropean business class product even though they promote  sell business class IntraEurope flights feature the same 33 seating throughout the aircraft  the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in business class  passengers get a meal  drinks but this does not justify the higher cost BAs TransAtlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the narrow 8 across seating The biggest surprise on both the LISLHR  LHRIAH flights was that BA has in fact substantially improved their food quality Shocking Unfortunately it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown The entertainment  system  small screens  my laptop screen is twice the size  is like an airline offering 2 decades ago The flight crew was pleasant  perfunctory which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore Emirates Qatar Etihad EVA ANA Japan Air New Zealand Qantas or many others BA can compete with USbased airlines like Delta American  United which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a highquality business class product One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class Several hundred US dollars for TransAtlantic flights Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain,Extremely Positive

290,290,0.015,0.851,0.134,0.9698,Mumbai to London Heathrow in Business Class on an ageing B777200 This aircraft featured the older Club World flatbed seats They are comfortable there is enough storage space around the cubicle and the monitor screen is among the larger ones Ive seen on airplanes BAs new Club Suites are said to be far superior competing with the best Bclass rivals The entire Business Class cabin had just 2 washrooms but it wasnt an issue on this flight since the premier section wasnt at full capacity There was WiFi on board fast enough to even send videos via messaging apps Service onboard was competent but the staff lacked warmth The food was alright and no more The biggest plus of this flight is that it gets out of Bombay at 110 pm in the afternoon instead of the ungodly early morning hours most international flights take off from India The airport experience is far more pleasant at this time In summary British Airways provides a good but not spectacular Business Class product,Extremely Positive

255,255,0.05,0.784,0.165,0.9879,  I am a frequent flyer with BA and have been for the last 15 years Having noted the ratings given frankly I cannot understand how BA scores three stars for most aspects of its service In a nutshell BA has placed profit margins over passenger appreciation This fact was hammered home on my return leg which was not in Club Europe Quite alarmingly BA appears to place profit over passenger safety by extending its Business Class seating up to and beyond emergency exit rows and then failing to ensure those seated in exit rows have the physical capacity to actually open the door incase of an emergency I was not at all reassured to see an elderly and slightly built woman seated with the responsibility of opening the overwing exit should the need have arisen Shorthaul business Club Europe is simply a joke and only useful for gaining valuable tier points for loungepreboarding benefits While cabin crew service is excellent the lack of space and reduction in refreshment choices etc places them a million airmiles behind competing airlines such as Qatar Turkish or Emirates who understand the true definition of customer appreciation and hospitality BA has consistently eroded the value of their Executive Club and seems to be of the impression that recent changes in obtaining avios points during the booking process benefit passengers  really I want to support BA and did enjoy flying with them up to the point when they started penny pinching and became more deserving of the name Budget Airways The attached photos taking during my most recent itinerary highlight the difference in customer careappreciation between British Airways and another airline used in this trip Both flights were around 4 hours in duration on the same day Guess which one is shows BAs inflight offering,Extremely Positive

3613,3613,0.061,0.813,0.126,0.9856, Check in was chaotic and badly organised Even though there were two desks one for premium and one economy there ended up being just one queue in front of the premium check in even though most passengers in it were economy That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers unnecessarily badly organised the staff in charge should be retrained Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines and it is actually quite good overall Nice layout and seating options reasonable food and drink options and an outdoor terrace which is really nice Boarding was very well organised although quite slow to get everyone on board but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards although as previously commented are really not very good overall the meal service was disappointing As is normal BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option  when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I’ve ever had in any cabin class rolling some mush similar consistency to mashed potato into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage BA you need to improve the meal options make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals  then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out Whilst I hadn’t planned on using it the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use Overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient I used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me,Extremely Positive

424,424,0.038,0.897,0.065,0.7992, I had broken my leg 2 days before our return flight from Lisbon to London I called to get some assistance from British Airways hoping for wheelchair assistance an easier seat to get to or possibly an upgrade so that I could stretch out my broken leg which was in a cast This airline failed on all fronts Quoted us a price of €6000 each I was traveling with my husband which we could not do Almost didnt let me on the plane trying to interpret my medical report They did not attempt to change our seats which were near the back The single concession they made was to allow me to board 1st but did not offer a wheelchair so I had to swing myself down the aisle to my seat using the arm rests of all 21 rows before my seat as the aisles are not wide enough for crutches Might I add I am nearly 70 Had to exit same way No wheelchair waiting for me at Heathrow had to hop onto bus with crutches to change terminals and nearly took a tumble doing so Took so long to get a wheelchair that they had to hold my connecting flight on another airline for me and we were last to board That flight had allowed us to upgrade to business class for a reasonable price and took great care of me,Extremely Positive

613,613,0.061,0.813,0.126,0.9856, Check in was chaotic and badly organised Even though there were two desks one for premium and one economy there ended up being just one queue in front of the premium check in even though most passengers in it were economy That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers unnecessarily badly organised the staff in charge should be retrained Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines and it is actually quite good overall Nice layout and seating options reasonable food and drink options and an outdoor terrace which is really nice Boarding was very well organised although quite slow to get everyone on board but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards although as previously commented are really not very good overall the meal service was disappointing As is normal BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option  when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I’ve ever had in any cabin class rolling some mush similar consistency to mashed potato into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage BA you need to improve the meal options make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals  then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out Whilst I hadn’t planned on using it the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use Overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient I used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me,Extremely Positive

608,608,0.069,0.803,0.128,0.9737,Absolutely pathetic business class product BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market With old outdated 8 across seating  no I did not make a typing mistake  you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats BA like most other Europeanbased airlines does not have a factual IntraEuropean business class product even though they promote  sell business class IntraEurope flights feature the same 33 seating throughout the aircraft  the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in business class  passengers get a meal  drinks but this does not justify the higher cost BAs TransAtlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the narrow 8 across seating The biggest surprise on both the LISLHR  LHRIAH flights was that BA has in fact substantially improved their food quality Shocking Unfortunately it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown The entertainment  system  small screens  my laptop screen is twice the size  is like an airline offering 2 decades ago The flight crew was pleasant  perfunctory which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore Emirates Qatar Etihad EVA ANA Japan Air New Zealand Qantas or many others BA can compete with USbased airlines like Delta American  United which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a highquality business class product One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class Several hundred US dollars for TransAtlantic flights Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain,Extremely Positive
621,621,0.086,0.689,0.225,0.9977,     The check in area for premium classes at Gatwick is very nice and there was no queue when I arrived so I was able to drop my bag very quickly Premium security at Gatwick is fine The flight was delayed due to NATS issues but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this The lounge is nicevand it’ very comfortable There was an excellent range of food and drinks All the drinks you would expect Food wise there were sandwiches soup pasta salads fruit Spanish stew as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy It was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options Boarding was pretty slow although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first As has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on ba Europe business is pretty poor but in line with other European carriers sadly That being said the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good The on board catering was of excellent quality I was lucky to get my preferred option of the roast turkey but several people sat near me weren’t as lucky I do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings vegetarian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to get the proper meal  Or failing that allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat Whilst I fully support the desire to minimise waste both food and cost people really should really be able to get the ideal meal option Unfortunately one of the people affected reacted very badly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was The cabin crew were  very nice friendly and professional if a little slow but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience I had The ground service at Gran Canaria was pretty poor priority bags clearly meant nothing 95 of bags coming out were not priority mine came out about halfway through bag delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers Overall though it was a very nice flight and having paid for it using avios and £1 I cannot complain at all,Extremely Positive

3033,3033,0.1,0.834,0.066,-0.8042, 5 days before the flight we were advised by BA that it had been cancelled and asked us to rebook There were flights 1 hour before and 1 hour after our original flight but they made us take one 3 hours earlier Our original ticket and the return flight a week later included a checked bag When we arrive at Heathrow to check in we are told our ticket doesnt included a bag and we will have to pay 75 pounds each to take them We explained that the original ticket had the bags and when they checked the system they confirmed that it did but not this one They would make no effort to sort it out and just told us to pay up or they would remove us from the flight So we had no choice but to pay up thinking it should be pretty easy to get a refund 15 months and 10 emails later we have still not seen a penny Every time I ask where my refund is and state how long we have been waiting I get an inane email saying some departments take longer than others to respond  Absolutely hopeless airline to stuff up the booking in the first place and even worse customer service to not even attempt to solve the problem at check in even when they could see the mistake THEY had made in their system compounded by being be unable to investigate a very simple claim and refund me 150 pounds in 15 months,Very Negative
3211,3211,0.14,0.767,0.093,-0.8855,I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways specifically regarding their customer service After my initial flight leg was canceled I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes Realizing the impracticality of this I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 34 hours Shockingly the customer support representative flatly refused citing an inability to change my flight Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures I received no assistance To add to the frustration the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation Moreover the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India allegedly contributing to the subpar service This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future The lack of assistance blameshifting and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service,Very Negative
3031,3031,0.136,0.783,0.081,-0.85, I recently had a delay on British Airways from BRU to LHR that was due to staff shortages They announced that there was a 2 hour holding delay but they would board us immediately in hopes of clearing the gate and leaving early We had to wait the full 2 hours inside the airplane The plane was old dirty had no power at the seats The staff provided a small bag of pretzels and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight There were no options to purchase food or drink There were no entertainment options available I am a OneWorld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status First class lounges at Heathrow are overcrowded understaffed and poorly equipped The help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations  even when having the top status The Avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket British has lost its way in recent years and has a moved from a worldclass airline to a budget airline with much worse service and timeliness than Ryanair or EasyJet,Very Negative

911,911,0.14,0.767,0.093,-0.8855,I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways specifically regarding their customer service After my initial flight leg was canceled I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes Realizing the impracticality of this I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 34 hours Shockingly the customer support representative flatly refused citing an inability to change my flight Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures I received no assistance To add to the frustration the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation Moreover the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India allegedly contributing to the subpar service This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future The lack of assistance blameshifting and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service,Very Negative

893,893,0.142,0.808,0.051,-0.931, British Airways absolutely does not care My reserved seat was change from an aisle to center seat for this overnight full flight and it was quite awful After enquiring at LAX check in the agent said sorry nothing we can do Onboard the flight the attendants seemed to try and finish the meal service at a racing speed with meals trays passed out with no proper questions about choice Then back and clearing trays and they disappeared to rest in the kitchen for hours after that No water runs if you need anything do not bother with the call bell as they simply ignore it I used to like travelling British Airways 1015 years ago but the bean counters have been in and lowered it close to a lowcost carrier I guess staff are badly paid from their terrible attitude and service My last trip to London was with Delta they are so much better than this very poor excuse of an airline that British Air has now become,Very Negative
892,892,0.157,0.758,0.085,-0.9475, Flying A380 business class should be a pleasure but BA has made it a disaster with the worst seating and configuration imaginable How could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy Seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised The Tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position There is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping  The window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of The whole business class set up is a sick joke Eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off Are there any redeeming features  the answer is no If you like a little comfort avoid BA like the plague,Very Negative
888,888,0.085,0.851,0.064,-0.8095, British Airways has a total lack of respect for its customers I was booked to fly from Frankfurt Main to London City Airport and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by BA without explanation when I was already at the airport The worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers The ground staff’s attitude was that they are merely third party agents not BA employees and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all telling us we had to contact BA directly via phone if we wanted help They couldn’t even provide us a phone number telling us to look it up on bacom  So BA abandoned its passengers They did tell us that the BA departure to Heathrow had also been cancelled meaning there would be no further BA flight from Frankfurt to London that day although other airlines were still operating the route but BA refused to rebook us on them The reason given for both cancellations was “technical reasons” No assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation nor any information on help regarding food accommodation help etc Their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem not theirs I received an email an hour later notifying me that I had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later which wasn’t acceptable as I had to get back to London that night I rang BA’s call centre and again they showed a high degree of callousness 95 of the halfhour call was spent with me waiting on hold with the phone just cutting off after half an hour and no meaningful information given to me by that point There was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut and I had a solid phone signal and wifi as I was still standing in Terminal 2 of Frankfurt Main airport even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details They just don’t care In the end I had to arrange my own return to London by taking a coach to Hanh airport which was 112km away  waiting there for 5 hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with Ryanair to Stansted At least that flight operated on time and got me back to London BA is worse than a low cost carrier now,Very Negative

876,876,0.151,0.802,0.047,-0.958, I fly British Airways weekly not because I want to but because they own the route there’s no other option therefore they frankly don’t have to care about the customer The flights are always delayed and it’s always someone else’s fault be it weather delays to incoming aircraft or flight traffic control issues I’ve heard it all and for the life of me cannot understand why they are allowed to operate I’ve been around the world and traveled with all of the world’s airlines but British Airways are really the worst of the worst It’s such a shame to have watched what used to be a good company fall down a cliff My advice is if you have an option to fly with anyone else then exercise the option but if you’re flying with different connections and you have a tight schedule do not expect BA to get you to your destination in time,Very Negative
875,875,0.129,0.84,0.03,-0.9747, We started our day with BA in Prague The flight actually left on time I came to find out that’s very unusual We purchased business class seats As you can see from the picture they hardly were business class All they did was block off the middle seat in the first few rows and called it business class Horrible flight In addition I had a really rude rude check in clerk basically yell at me when I excused myself and asked if she could give a little bit of priority to the many business class passengers who weren’t being served Then we got to Heathrow and the real fun began We had a 4 hour delay They gave us about 5 different excuses for the delay I had a few employees walk away while I was asking them questions They were very rude At one point there were no employees left And from the announcements it seems virtually every BA flight was delayed And there were no weather issues There was no place to comfortably store items in business class I’ve never experienced that before Not even a cup holder for my bottle of water The seat controls didn’t work well You had to keep pushing the buttons to get them to do anything The power outlet didn’t work There was no internet the entire flight The overhead luggage bin was too heavy I almost got a hernia having to close it This is a horrible airline I’ll never fly with them again If I could give zero stars I would,Very Negative

951,951,0.096,0.878,0.026,-0.7717,  The flight departed over an hour late due to a late inbound plane The plane was very full and half of the economy class passengers were forced to check in their larger cabin baggage at the gate when boarding making a complete mockery of the hand luggage allowance advertised Lots of passengers on board were stressed out about missing onwards connections due to the delays and some did miss them as their next gates had closed by the time we disembarked at Heathrow Onboard service was ok but minimal   BA gave up being a fullservice airline some time ago More concerning is that trying to get hold of customers services to make changes to bookings and deal with problems was nonexistent The airline seems to make it deliberately hard for its customers to contact it,Very Negative

954,954,0.081,0.865,0.055,-0.7932,The customer services call centres etc are atrocious and sometimes callous They just don’t care Long waits to speak to anybody who then have no power to actually solve anything and the calls just cut halfway without resolution anyway If the flights are cancelled as were my original ones you’re really left on your own and nobody cares The onboard services are soso but for short haul it’s now “semilow cost” which is confusing as you never know what to expect This time we were given a bottle of water and a very small snack whilst anything else had to be paid for And yet on some other flights apparently you have to preorder any additional food It’s confusing which makes it not dependable Cabin baggage is in theory generous compared to competitors in economy but then they asked more than half the passengers on this flight to check in the cabin baggage at the gate due to lack of space in the overhead cabins leading to long boarding delays Their whole offering hasn’t been thought through very well  The USB power supply did not work throughout the flight contrary to the announcement that the power be available after the seatbelt sight was turned off  so it was pointless providing the sockets in the first place Not my first choice airline on this route and am just trying to use up most of my Avios points before I totally abandon them I fail to see how it is deemed a 4 star airline,Very Negative

1011,1011,0.14,0.767,0.093,-0.8855,I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways specifically regarding their customer service After my initial flight leg was canceled I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes Realizing the impracticality of this I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 34 hours Shockingly the customer support representative flatly refused citing an inability to change my flight Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures I received no assistance To add to the frustration the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation Moreover the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India allegedly contributing to the subpar service This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future The lack of assistance blameshifting and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service,Very Negative

993,993,0.142,0.808,0.051,-0.931, British Airways absolutely does not care My reserved seat was change from an aisle to center seat for this overnight full flight and it was quite awful After enquiring at LAX check in the agent said sorry nothing we can do Onboard the flight the attendants seemed to try and finish the meal service at a racing speed with meals trays passed out with no proper questions about choice Then back and clearing trays and they disappeared to rest in the kitchen for hours after that No water runs if you need anything do not bother with the call bell as they simply ignore it I used to like travelling British Airways 1015 years ago but the bean counters have been in and lowered it close to a lowcost carrier I guess staff are badly paid from their terrible attitude and service My last trip to London was with Delta they are so much better than this very poor excuse of an airline that British Air has now become,Very Negative
992,992,0.157,0.758,0.085,-0.9475, Flying A380 business class should be a pleasure but BA has made it a disaster with the worst seating and configuration imaginable How could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy Seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised The Tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position There is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping  The window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of The whole business class set up is a sick joke Eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off Are there any redeeming features  the answer is no If you like a little comfort avoid BA like the plague,Very Negative
988,988,0.085,0.851,0.064,-0.8095, British Airways has a total lack of respect for its customers I was booked to fly from Frankfurt Main to London City Airport and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by BA without explanation when I was already at the airport The worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers The ground staff’s attitude was that they are merely third party agents not BA employees and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all telling us we had to contact BA directly via phone if we wanted help They couldn’t even provide us a phone number telling us to look it up on bacom  So BA abandoned its passengers They did tell us that the BA departure to Heathrow had also been cancelled meaning there would be no further BA flight from Frankfurt to London that day although other airlines were still operating the route but BA refused to rebook us on them The reason given for both cancellations was “technical reasons” No assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation nor any information on help regarding food accommodation help etc Their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem not theirs I received an email an hour later notifying me that I had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later which wasn’t acceptable as I had to get back to London that night I rang BA’s call centre and again they showed a high degree of callousness 95 of the halfhour call was spent with me waiting on hold with the phone just cutting off after half an hour and no meaningful information given to me by that point There was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut and I had a solid phone signal and wifi as I was still standing in Terminal 2 of Frankfurt Main airport even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details They just don’t care In the end I had to arrange my own return to London by taking a coach to Hanh airport which was 112km away  waiting there for 5 hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with Ryanair to Stansted At least that flight operated on time and got me back to London BA is worse than a low cost carrier now,Very Negative

811,811,0.14,0.767,0.093,-0.8855,I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways specifically regarding their customer service After my initial flight leg was canceled I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes Realizing the impracticality of this I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 34 hours Shockingly the customer support representative flatly refused citing an inability to change my flight Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures I received no assistance To add to the frustration the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation Moreover the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India allegedly contributing to the subpar service This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future The lack of assistance blameshifting and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service,Very Negative

1277,1277,0.144,0.773,0.084,-0.9635,Not    Everything was ok until our connecting flight in London just before take off we were on the runway the pilot came on to announce an engine problem After engineers tried to fix it while we waited on the plane for over an hour we were finally told that we would have to be evacuated and rebooked for another flight but not to worry because a special crew was waiting for us on the ground to help us and set us up in a hotel except that there was no one to help us In fact everyone refused to help us It was Saturday almost 8pm and they just wanted to go home Anyone with a connecting flight couldnt rebook on the application because the app wouldnt disassociate our first flight with the connecting one in London and the staff saw this but still refused to help us They gave us a phone number but there was only a message that said just to use the app Finally I got someone on the phone who rebooked us for the next day Now its 1030pm and I have to find a hotel room because the airline refused also to help us with that So i had 2 choices either sleep in the airport or pay over 700GBP for a room I dont have the money to pay for this but after a 10 hour flight 8 hours of jet lag and the insane stress after the fact that no one from British Airways would help us I took the room Of course I claimed reimbursement but that was over 3 weeks ago and I havent heard anything since so I have no idea when or how much Ill be reimbursed even though Im not claiming any emotional compensation from the horrible situation they put me through due to their total indifference Its financially difficult for me right now because the money I had to put out is equal to half my salary and of course its impossible to reach them by phone I feel still as i did on August 26 2023 completely trapped by them and their indifference with no solution or information,Very Negative

1272,1272,0.158,0.831,0.012,-0.983,One of the worst experiences on the worst airline The flight was delayed due to earlier technical issues The time slipped from 1700 to 2000 to 2200 and finally cancelled There was zero information given Despite paying well over the odds for business class we were booted out of the BA lounge two hours before the flight When it was finally cancelled the BA staff Without explanation told everyone to go to a gate After another hour or so they made us re enter the UK via passport control a further 40 minute wait By now the airport was closing and there was no sign of our bags or any help from BA A passing Gatwick engineer finally helped us locate the bags BA completely washed their hands of us and in contravention of CAA rules refused to find us accommodation Many slept in a bus stop overnight There were people with young children who couldn’t find somewhere to stay and yet BA had closed down and left The following day the replacement flight was also late and due to an admin mistake had no catering or liquids for a 2 12 hr flight Overall the service was shockingly bad the worst I have experienced from any airline I will not ever use them again,Very Negative

1258,1258,0.105,0.847,0.048,-0.8395,  The already delayed aircraft landed and apart from the small BA logo on the rear of the fuselage there was no indication as to whom the carrier really was Boarding turned into a farce with passenger groups being told to wait in one queue in order to board only to be informed we were on the wrong place and our boarding wasnt allowed yet The interior cabin was reminiscent of a BA cabin from twenty years earlier except the tight legroom and uncomfortable seating which made a budget airline feel luxurious The crew were not BA but from an unknown charter company Service was slow and as usual choices of food to purchase ran out before theyd reached row 24 I requested a cup of tea which never appeared Thank goodness for my airport purchased water and the tiny offering of pretzels The over officious senior flight attendant whod been facilitating in Club Europe appeared in economy and immediately slammed down the armrests whilst still in mid flight making an already uncomfortable journey feel worse Cattle class was definitely that To say I was happy to land and disembark was an understatement Never again BA never again,Very Negative

1251,1251,0.096,0.878,0.026,-0.7717,  The flight departed over an hour late due to a late inbound plane The plane was very full and half of the economy class passengers were forced to check in their larger cabin baggage at the gate when boarding making a complete mockery of the hand luggage allowance advertised Lots of passengers on board were stressed out about missing onwards connections due to the delays and some did miss them as their next gates had closed by the time we disembarked at Heathrow Onboard service was ok but minimal   BA gave up being a fullservice airline some time ago More concerning is that trying to get hold of customers services to make changes to bookings and deal with problems was nonexistent The airline seems to make it deliberately hard for its customers to contact it,Very Negative

1211,1211,0.14,0.767,0.093,-0.8855,I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways specifically regarding their customer service After my initial flight leg was canceled I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes Realizing the impracticality of this I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 34 hours Shockingly the customer support representative flatly refused citing an inability to change my flight Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures I received no assistance To add to the frustration the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation Moreover the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India allegedly contributing to the subpar service This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future The lack of assistance blameshifting and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service,Very Negative
1288,1288,0.085,0.851,0.064,-0.8095, British Airways has a total lack of respect for its customers I was booked to fly from Frankfurt Main to London City Airport and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by BA without explanation when I was already at the airport The worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers The ground staff’s attitude was that they are merely third party agents not BA employees and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all telling us we had to contact BA directly via phone if we wanted help They couldn’t even provide us a phone number telling us to look it up on bacom  So BA abandoned its passengers They did tell us that the BA departure to Heathrow had also been cancelled meaning there would be no further BA flight from Frankfurt to London that day although other airlines were still operating the route but BA refused to rebook us on them The reason given for both cancellations was “technical reasons” No assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation nor any information on help regarding food accommodation help etc Their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem not theirs I received an email an hour later notifying me that I had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later which wasn’t acceptable as I had to get back to London that night I rang BA’s call centre and again they showed a high degree of callousness 95 of the halfhour call was spent with me waiting on hold with the phone just cutting off after half an hour and no meaningful information given to me by that point There was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut and I had a solid phone signal and wifi as I was still standing in Terminal 2 of Frankfurt Main airport even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details They just don’t care In the end I had to arrange my own return to London by taking a coach to Hanh airport which was 112km away  waiting there for 5 hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with Ryanair to Stansted At least that flight operated on time and got me back to London BA is worse than a low cost carrier now,Very Negative

1374,1374,0.066,0.907,0.027,-0.8689,I had a flight from Miami Florida to Dublin Ireland via Londons Heathrow airport The outbound flight from Miami was delayed and we were further delayed when our gate was occupied when we arrived in Heathrow The total delay was roughly an hour but it was enough to make our connection a challenge where we had 73 minutes between original arrival time until the departure time to Dublin When we headed to our connection flight we were stopped by security personnel at a checkpoint and told us that the gate to our connection flight had already closed This was twenty minutes prior to departure time They ushered us to customer service to be rebooked Given the busy weekend of travel we were rebooked on a flight at a different airport and were told that our cost to get there would be reimbursed We then waited 3 hours for our luggage and then took a cab to Londons City Airport The cab fare was roughly 500 When I filed a claim with British Airways they refused the claim and told me that we had plenty of time to make our connecting flight and therefore they denied my claim to be reimbursed for the cab fare This is after I explained that it was British Airways employees who ushered us to rebook the flight despite the 20 minute timeframe to make the connecting flight The person who rebooked us told us it was policy that they close the gate 20 minutes prior to departure I will never fly this awful airline again Given the other feedback on this site it appears that that is the overwhelming sentiment,Very Negative
1372,1372,0.158,0.831,0.012,-0.983,One of the worst experiences on the worst airline The flight was delayed due to earlier technical issues The time slipped from 1700 to 2000 to 2200 and finally cancelled There was zero information given Despite paying well over the odds for business class we were booted out of the BA lounge two hours before the flight When it was finally cancelled the BA staff Without explanation told everyone to go to a gate After another hour or so they made us re enter the UK via passport control a further 40 minute wait By now the airport was closing and there was no sign of our bags or any help from BA A passing Gatwick engineer finally helped us locate the bags BA completely washed their hands of us and in contravention of CAA rules refused to find us accommodation Many slept in a bus stop overnight There were people with young children who couldn’t find somewhere to stay and yet BA had closed down and left The following day the replacement flight was also late and due to an admin mistake had no catering or liquids for a 2 12 hr flight Overall the service was shockingly bad the worst I have experienced from any airline I will not ever use them again,Very Negative

1370,1370,0.121,0.813,0.066,-0.926, The worst journey in my life The connection time at LHR was only 1 hour but the flight from MXP was on delay I had to rush to change terminal by train and arrived risking a heart attack After that the plane just stayed there for another 40 minutes Despite that upon arrival at SJC my baggage was lost I filled the form and gave to the employee I was not given any receipt so I did not have any reference number BA phone number at SJC simply never answer I called twice the toll free number and realized they did not record the delivery address I had to enter myself online dealing with a shitty website They delivered the baggage three days later I claimed for compensation online as I had to buy clothes and other stuff and I did never get a receipt I was expecting an upgrade for the flight back to MXP but nothing happened neither they allowed me to enter BA lounge at SJC Bad customer service The only positive side was price but obviously this cannot justify this treatment and if I knew  I would never flown by BA Never again,Very Negative
1358,1358,0.105,0.847,0.048,-0.8395,  The already delayed aircraft landed and apart from the small BA logo on the rear of the fuselage there was no indication as to whom the carrier really was Boarding turned into a farce with passenger groups being told to wait in one queue in order to board only to be informed we were on the wrong place and our boarding wasnt allowed yet The interior cabin was reminiscent of a BA cabin from twenty years earlier except the tight legroom and uncomfortable seating which made a budget airline feel luxurious The crew were not BA but from an unknown charter company Service was slow and as usual choices of food to purchase ran out before theyd reached row 24 I requested a cup of tea which never appeared Thank goodness for my airport purchased water and the tiny offering of pretzels The over officious senior flight attendant whod been facilitating in Club Europe appeared in economy and immediately slammed down the armrests whilst still in mid flight making an already uncomfortable journey feel worse Cattle class was definitely that To say I was happy to land and disembark was an understatement Never again BA never again,Very Negative
1357,1357,0.15,0.767,0.083,-0.9273,  They downgraded me from business to premium economy They took three months to get back to me and offered me 200 pounds or 400 AUD The difference between business class and premium economy which I never fly is 3000 AUD and the difference between economy and business is 6500 AUD They owe me at least 1500 pounds and to be very fair 3250 pounds The downgrade was insulting and incredibly painful as I had a recent cancer operation and have a back injury which I have pointed out to them  I need to lie down The wait for them to get around to me has been numbing The insult of their offer has been the slap in the face to continue my degradation The people I have dealt with at the airport have been down to earth honest hard working people The actual staff on the plane were warm and friendly  and helpful The systems under which BA operates are some sort of medieval torture,Very Negative
1354,1354,0.081,0.865,0.055,-0.7932,The customer services call centres etc are atrocious and sometimes callous They just don’t care Long waits to speak to anybody who then have no power to actually solve anything and the calls just cut halfway without resolution anyway If the flights are cancelled as were my original ones you’re really left on your own and nobody cares The onboard services are soso but for short haul it’s now “semilow cost” which is confusing as you never know what to expect This time we were given a bottle of water and a very small snack whilst anything else had to be paid for And yet on some other flights apparently you have to preorder any additional food It’s confusing which makes it not dependable Cabin baggage is in theory generous compared to competitors in economy but then they asked more than half the passengers on this flight to check in the cabin baggage at the gate due to lack of space in the overhead cabins leading to long boarding delays Their whole offering hasn’t been thought through very well  The USB power supply did not work throughout the flight contrary to the announcement that the power be available after the seatbelt sight was turned off  so it was pointless providing the sockets in the first place Not my first choice airline on this route and am just trying to use up most of my Avios points before I totally abandon them I fail to see how it is deemed a 4 star airline,Very Negative
1352,1352,0.143,0.857,0.0,-0.8885,  I hate British Airways We get to London on Oct 3 and our next flight is cancelled We stand in line with 1200 other people to get it fixed and they tell everyone to leave the airport and call them to fix They book us the next dayvia online Dont offer vouchers for hotel we will miss our tour Now trying to get home from Istanbul Plane is here but should have started loading an hour ago No explanations May miss next flight Will never travel with them again Was this same problem April 2022 flight,Very Negative
1351,1351,0.096,0.878,0.026,-0.7717,  The flight departed over an hour late due to a late inbound plane The plane was very full and half of the economy class passengers were forced to check in their larger cabin baggage at the gate when boarding making a complete mockery of the hand luggage allowance advertised Lots of passengers on board were stressed out about missing onwards connections due to the delays and some did miss them as their next gates had closed by the time we disembarked at Heathrow Onboard service was ok but minimal   BA gave up being a fullservice airline some time ago More concerning is that trying to get hold of customers services to make changes to bookings and deal with problems was nonexistent The airline seems to make it deliberately hard for its customers to contact it,Very Negative
1349,1349,0.126,0.834,0.04,-0.9091,  I flew from Istanbul to London in Business class For more than half of the flight a child was watching an iPad very loud with no phones plugged in  it was three rows in front of me and disrupted my flight as I could hear it above my headphones Staff thought this was fine and refused to tell the mom to turn it down Why is this acceptable on a flight especially in business class Has this airline turned into a zoo Are staff given no training in customer service Why is a child allowed to disrupt other passengers When I told the staff she just laughed at me BA customer service is a disgrace Ive not even mentioned the food but it was bad really bad,Very Negative

1333,1333,0.1,0.834,0.066,-0.8042, 5 days before the flight we were advised by BA that it had been cancelled and asked us to rebook There were flights 1 hour before and 1 hour after our original flight but they made us take one 3 hours earlier Our original ticket and the return flight a week later included a checked bag When we arrive at Heathrow to check in we are told our ticket doesnt included a bag and we will have to pay 75 pounds each to take them We explained that the original ticket had the bags and when they checked the system they confirmed that it did but not this one They would make no effort to sort it out and just told us to pay up or they would remove us from the flight So we had no choice but to pay up thinking it should be pretty easy to get a refund 15 months and 10 emails later we have still not seen a penny Every time I ask where my refund is and state how long we have been waiting I get an inane email saying some departments take longer than others to respond  Absolutely hopeless airline to stuff up the booking in the first place and even worse customer service to not even attempt to solve the problem at check in even when they could see the mistake THEY had made in their system compounded by being be unable to investigate a very simple claim and refund me 150 pounds in 15 months,Very Negative
1331,1331,0.136,0.783,0.081,-0.85, I recently had a delay on British Airways from BRU to LHR that was due to staff shortages They announced that there was a 2 hour holding delay but they would board us immediately in hopes of clearing the gate and leaving early We had to wait the full 2 hours inside the airplane The plane was old dirty had no power at the seats The staff provided a small bag of pretzels and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight There were no options to purchase food or drink There were no entertainment options available I am a OneWorld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status First class lounges at Heathrow are overcrowded understaffed and poorly equipped The help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations  even when having the top status The Avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket British has lost its way in recent years and has a moved from a worldclass airline to a budget airline with much worse service and timeliness than Ryanair or EasyJet,Very Negative

1328,1328,0.132,0.789,0.079,-0.9641,Dear Community I feel compelled to share the utter frustration and disappointment that defined my recent travel experience with British Airways Buckle up folks this ones a rollercoaster On July 16 and 17 2023 I had the displeasure of flying with British Airways on BA709 and BA7 and let me tell you it was a nightmare The initial flight from Zurich ZRH to London LHR on BA709 faced a seemingly unavoidable onehour delay upon arrival at LHR This of course resulted in me missing my connection to Tokyo triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to Tokyo HND via Beijing with Air China Oh but the fun didnt stop there — flight CA183 was also delayed turning my 16hour delay into a grand total of 23 hours finally arriving in Tokyo at 2300 instead of the promised 710 And the cherry on top My four checkedin suitcases decided to take a detour and didnt join me in Tokyo forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the baggage center I finally got my lost luggage back on July 23 because why make it easy right But wait theres more My return flight from Tokyo to Zurich BA8 on August 8 also danced to the delay tune making me question if punctuality is just a myth for British Airways The cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans stealing a whole day of scheduled activities including a guided Tokyo tour As if that werent enough I had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expenses—extra airport transfers tour operator assistance fees emergency purchases airport meals and international calls for rearrangements The lack of assistance at LHR airport was the icing on this bitter cake Installing the BA app just to get basic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle and the fact that no BA clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating British Airways youve left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet Heres hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now its not a good look Frustrated and fed up Bert,Very Negative

1176,1176,0.151,0.802,0.047,-0.958, I fly British Airways weekly not because I want to but because they own the route there’s no other option therefore they frankly don’t have to care about the customer The flights are always delayed and it’s always someone else’s fault be it weather delays to incoming aircraft or flight traffic control issues I’ve heard it all and for the life of me cannot understand why they are allowed to operate I’ve been around the world and traveled with all of the world’s airlines but British Airways are really the worst of the worst It’s such a shame to have watched what used to be a good company fall down a cliff My advice is if you have an option to fly with anyone else then exercise the option but if you’re flying with different connections and you have a tight schedule do not expect BA to get you to your destination in time,Very Negative
1175,1175,0.129,0.84,0.03,-0.9747, We started our day with BA in Prague The flight actually left on time I came to find out that’s very unusual We purchased business class seats As you can see from the picture they hardly were business class All they did was block off the middle seat in the first few rows and called it business class Horrible flight In addition I had a really rude rude check in clerk basically yell at me when I excused myself and asked if she could give a little bit of priority to the many business class passengers who weren’t being served Then we got to Heathrow and the real fun began We had a 4 hour delay They gave us about 5 different excuses for the delay I had a few employees walk away while I was asking them questions They were very rude At one point there were no employees left And from the announcements it seems virtually every BA flight was delayed And there were no weather issues There was no place to comfortably store items in business class I’ve never experienced that before Not even a cup holder for my bottle of water The seat controls didn’t work well You had to keep pushing the buttons to get them to do anything The power outlet didn’t work There was no internet the entire flight The overhead luggage bin was too heavy I almost got a hernia having to close it This is a horrible airline I’ll never fly with them again If I could give zero stars I would,Very Negative
1174,1174,0.066,0.907,0.027,-0.8689,I had a flight from Miami Florida to Dublin Ireland via Londons Heathrow airport The outbound flight from Miami was delayed and we were further delayed when our gate was occupied when we arrived in Heathrow The total delay was roughly an hour but it was enough to make our connection a challenge where we had 73 minutes between original arrival time until the departure time to Dublin When we headed to our connection flight we were stopped by security personnel at a checkpoint and told us that the gate to our connection flight had already closed This was twenty minutes prior to departure time They ushered us to customer service to be rebooked Given the busy weekend of travel we were rebooked on a flight at a different airport and were told that our cost to get there would be reimbursed We then waited 3 hours for our luggage and then took a cab to Londons City Airport The cab fare was roughly 500 When I filed a claim with British Airways they refused the claim and told me that we had plenty of time to make our connecting flight and therefore they denied my claim to be reimbursed for the cab fare This is after I explained that it was British Airways employees who ushered us to rebook the flight despite the 20 minute timeframe to make the connecting flight The person who rebooked us told us it was policy that they close the gate 20 minutes prior to departure I will never fly this awful airline again Given the other feedback on this site it appears that that is the overwhelming sentiment,Very Negative
1172,1172,0.158,0.831,0.012,-0.983,One of the worst experiences on the worst airline The flight was delayed due to earlier technical issues The time slipped from 1700 to 2000 to 2200 and finally cancelled There was zero information given Despite paying well over the odds for business class we were booted out of the BA lounge two hours before the flight When it was finally cancelled the BA staff Without explanation told everyone to go to a gate After another hour or so they made us re enter the UK via passport control a further 40 minute wait By now the airport was closing and there was no sign of our bags or any help from BA A passing Gatwick engineer finally helped us locate the bags BA completely washed their hands of us and in contravention of CAA rules refused to find us accommodation Many slept in a bus stop overnight There were people with young children who couldn’t find somewhere to stay and yet BA had closed down and left The following day the replacement flight was also late and due to an admin mistake had no catering or liquids for a 2 12 hr flight Overall the service was shockingly bad the worst I have experienced from any airline I will not ever use them again,Very Negative

1158,1158,0.105,0.847,0.048,-0.8395,  The already delayed aircraft landed and apart from the small BA logo on the rear of the fuselage there was no indication as to whom the carrier really was Boarding turned into a farce with passenger groups being told to wait in one queue in order to board only to be informed we were on the wrong place and our boarding wasnt allowed yet The interior cabin was reminiscent of a BA cabin from twenty years earlier except the tight legroom and uncomfortable seating which made a budget airline feel luxurious The crew were not BA but from an unknown charter company Service was slow and as usual choices of food to purchase ran out before theyd reached row 24 I requested a cup of tea which never appeared Thank goodness for my airport purchased water and the tiny offering of pretzels The over officious senior flight attendant whod been facilitating in Club Europe appeared in economy and immediately slammed down the armrests whilst still in mid flight making an already uncomfortable journey feel worse Cattle class was definitely that To say I was happy to land and disembark was an understatement Never again BA never again,Very Negative

193,193,0.142,0.808,0.051,-0.931, British Airways absolutely does not care My reserved seat was change from an aisle to center seat for this overnight full flight and it was quite awful After enquiring at LAX check in the agent said sorry nothing we can do Onboard the flight the attendants seemed to try and finish the meal service at a racing speed with meals trays passed out with no proper questions about choice Then back and clearing trays and they disappeared to rest in the kitchen for hours after that No water runs if you need anything do not bother with the call bell as they simply ignore it I used to like travelling British Airways 1015 years ago but the bean counters have been in and lowered it close to a lowcost carrier I guess staff are badly paid from their terrible attitude and service My last trip to London was with Delta they are so much better than this very poor excuse of an airline that British Air has now become,Very Negative
192,192,0.157,0.758,0.085,-0.9475, Flying A380 business class should be a pleasure but BA has made it a disaster with the worst seating and configuration imaginable How could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy Seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised The Tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position There is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping  The window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of The whole business class set up is a sick joke Eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off Are there any redeeming features  the answer is no If you like a little comfort avoid BA like the plague,Very Negative
188,188,0.085,0.851,0.064,-0.8095, British Airways has a total lack of respect for its customers I was booked to fly from Frankfurt Main to London City Airport and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by BA without explanation when I was already at the airport The worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers The ground staff’s attitude was that they are merely third party agents not BA employees and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all telling us we had to contact BA directly via phone if we wanted help They couldn’t even provide us a phone number telling us to look it up on bacom  So BA abandoned its passengers They did tell us that the BA departure to Heathrow had also been cancelled meaning there would be no further BA flight from Frankfurt to London that day although other airlines were still operating the route but BA refused to rebook us on them The reason given for both cancellations was “technical reasons” No assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation nor any information on help regarding food accommodation help etc Their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem not theirs I received an email an hour later notifying me that I had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later which wasn’t acceptable as I had to get back to London that night I rang BA’s call centre and again they showed a high degree of callousness 95 of the halfhour call was spent with me waiting on hold with the phone just cutting off after half an hour and no meaningful information given to me by that point There was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut and I had a solid phone signal and wifi as I was still standing in Terminal 2 of Frankfurt Main airport even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details They just don’t care In the end I had to arrange my own return to London by taking a coach to Hanh airport which was 112km away  waiting there for 5 hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with Ryanair to Stansted At least that flight operated on time and got me back to London BA is worse than a low cost carrier now,Very Negative

328,328,0.132,0.789,0.079,-0.9641,Dear Community I feel compelled to share the utter frustration and disappointment that defined my recent travel experience with British Airways Buckle up folks this ones a rollercoaster On July 16 and 17 2023 I had the displeasure of flying with British Airways on BA709 and BA7 and let me tell you it was a nightmare The initial flight from Zurich ZRH to London LHR on BA709 faced a seemingly unavoidable onehour delay upon arrival at LHR This of course resulted in me missing my connection to Tokyo triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to Tokyo HND via Beijing with Air China Oh but the fun didnt stop there — flight CA183 was also delayed turning my 16hour delay into a grand total of 23 hours finally arriving in Tokyo at 2300 instead of the promised 710 And the cherry on top My four checkedin suitcases decided to take a detour and didnt join me in Tokyo forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the baggage center I finally got my lost luggage back on July 23 because why make it easy right But wait theres more My return flight from Tokyo to Zurich BA8 on August 8 also danced to the delay tune making me question if punctuality is just a myth for British Airways The cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans stealing a whole day of scheduled activities including a guided Tokyo tour As if that werent enough I had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expenses—extra airport transfers tour operator assistance fees emergency purchases airport meals and international calls for rearrangements The lack of assistance at LHR airport was the icing on this bitter cake Installing the BA app just to get basic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle and the fact that no BA clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating British Airways youve left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet Heres hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now its not a good look Frustrated and fed up Bert,Very Negative
318,318,0.131,0.853,0.016,-0.9465,Once again a terrible business class experience with BA The flight was delayed by 45 hours The plane was very old with problems with at least 4 of the seats in business class not cleaned properly prior to departure Food was terrible as always with BA and only one choice available from advertised menu As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from Heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day  which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional 4 hour delay whilst at Heathrow At no point were we advised about our compensation rights despite asking at check in and connections or provided any vouchers during the delays Having flown Etihad Qatar and Virgin business class equivalents over the last year it is clear to see how big the gulf now is between BA and its rivals ,Very Negative
316,316,0.149,0.819,0.031,-0.9751, I was going to fly to Frankfurt from Glasgow over London but the flight from London to Frankfurt was cancelled This meant I had to stay overnight in London where I have no accommodation etc As I was rebooked to a flight from London City airport which was more than 2h by train I had to get an uber and then take a hotel for £250 in total London prices I was reassured over the phone that I would get all the money back My flight from London city airport was then cancelled again and rebooked to London Heathrow but two days later I then cancelled that flight and rebooked a new one with Lufthansa as I urgently had to get to work and needed the money I never received the money back for the hotel compensation for cancelled flight 1 compensation for cancelled flight 2 the extra food I had to pay for the uber or the actual cost of the flight I was first transferred 3€ by British Airways They stopped replying to me and told me the issue was weather conditions although other nonBA flights were going I lost over £700 in total and never got compensated for the loss of a work day either It just really feels like they dont care about people Worst serviceairline ever,Very Negative
312,312,0.124,0.859,0.017,-0.9359,Not    Beware BA dont provide any refund due to a very serious medical reason My father was diagnosed with a severe heart defect a couple of weeks before his flight date and BA refused to give any refund as this was not a good enough reason We sent them a medical note from his doctor saying he is unfit to travel due to potential heart failure and needs to have heart surgery as soon as possible and the operator totally dismissed it They said only thing they can do is change the travel date within a year Heart surgery recovery takes months and its highly unlikely that he will be able to travel within the year meaning he would lose his ticket and money They said they cant do anything to help not even change the name on the ticket so someone else can use the tickets The most ridiculous thing Ive heard,Very Negative
311,311,0.14,0.767,0.093,-0.8855,I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways specifically regarding their customer service After my initial flight leg was canceled I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes Realizing the impracticality of this I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 34 hours Shockingly the customer support representative flatly refused citing an inability to change my flight Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures I received no assistance To add to the frustration the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation Moreover the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India allegedly contributing to the subpar service This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future The lack of assistance blameshifting and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service,Very Negative
305,305,0.151,0.821,0.028,-0.9643, Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled thanks to strong tail winds The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks Nothing at all available to even buy to eat Worse than a lowcost carrier experience in this sense One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passengers head for the whole flight poor maintenance of cabin I would choose another airline on this route in the future as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin,Very Negative
303,303,0.101,0.837,0.062,-0.8462, My son and I flew to Geneva last Sunday for a skiing holiday in Les Arc The flight was cancelled moments prior to boarding and we were transferred to a flight departing three and a half hours later that then got delayed by a further three hours They didnt load any food on to the plane and forgot to load the baggage for all the business class passengers who had been on the earlier flight Problems happen its a complex operation What is totally unacceptable is the service one receives when there is a problem The offshore call centres are unhelpful and obstructive wanting to fob off issues by getting the customer to call special help lines that merely refer one to a webpage and then cut off The web pages are often unable to give information as they are not updated and often refuse to update your inputs at this time please try again later There is no access to people that are willing to help empowered to help or actually move a situation forwards in any way Weve been sitting in a hotel waiting for the bag to arrive for two and a half days unable to ski due to our entire wardrobes being in the cases The outdated luggage tracking system had the suitacase in Geneva 2 days ago where it sat with noone willing to step up and get it delivered What an incredibly heartless and incompetent company ,Very Negative

296,296,0.088,0.875,0.036,-0.8793, I flew London to Malaga on 27 August in Club Europe We stood around at Gate B45 in Terminal 5 for over an hour with staff giving very different reasons for the delay late inbound aircraft etc  but the plane we boarded had been sitting there for more than an hour After boarding the captain stated that because they had changed planes there would be no meals served This is Club Europe and we received one small packet of crisps throughout the flight No effort to apologise We smelt the hot meal for pilots being heated and then saw it being served to them on a Club Europe meal tray Cabin crew also had warmed pastries  and were very quick to use air freshener in the front galley while customers received zilch BA sent an email the following morning to say sorry  nothing else What a complete and utter rip off by an airline that is already cutting back on so many things I paid a full Business class fare did not receive any part of the onboard meal service and they expect an email to be sufficient Avoid BA if you have any other option nowadays they are the worst in Europe,Very Negative
293,293,0.142,0.808,0.051,-0.931, British Airways absolutely does not care My reserved seat was change from an aisle to center seat for this overnight full flight and it was quite awful After enquiring at LAX check in the agent said sorry nothing we can do Onboard the flight the attendants seemed to try and finish the meal service at a racing speed with meals trays passed out with no proper questions about choice Then back and clearing trays and they disappeared to rest in the kitchen for hours after that No water runs if you need anything do not bother with the call bell as they simply ignore it I used to like travelling British Airways 1015 years ago but the bean counters have been in and lowered it close to a lowcost carrier I guess staff are badly paid from their terrible attitude and service My last trip to London was with Delta they are so much better than this very poor excuse of an airline that British Air has now become,Very Negative
292,292,0.157,0.758,0.085,-0.9475, Flying A380 business class should be a pleasure but BA has made it a disaster with the worst seating and configuration imaginable How could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy Seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised The Tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position There is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping  The window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of The whole business class set up is a sick joke Eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off Are there any redeeming features  the answer is no If you like a little comfort avoid BA like the plague,Very Negative
288,288,0.085,0.851,0.064,-0.8095, British Airways has a total lack of respect for its customers I was booked to fly from Frankfurt Main to London City Airport and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by BA without explanation when I was already at the airport The worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers The ground staff’s attitude was that they are merely third party agents not BA employees and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all telling us we had to contact BA directly via phone if we wanted help They couldn’t even provide us a phone number telling us to look it up on bacom  So BA abandoned its passengers They did tell us that the BA departure to Heathrow had also been cancelled meaning there would be no further BA flight from Frankfurt to London that day although other airlines were still operating the route but BA refused to rebook us on them The reason given for both cancellations was “technical reasons” No assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation nor any information on help regarding food accommodation help etc Their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem not theirs I received an email an hour later notifying me that I had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later which wasn’t acceptable as I had to get back to London that night I rang BA’s call centre and again they showed a high degree of callousness 95 of the halfhour call was spent with me waiting on hold with the phone just cutting off after half an hour and no meaningful information given to me by that point There was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut and I had a solid phone signal and wifi as I was still standing in Terminal 2 of Frankfurt Main airport even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details They just don’t care In the end I had to arrange my own return to London by taking a coach to Hanh airport which was 112km away  waiting there for 5 hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with Ryanair to Stansted At least that flight operated on time and got me back to London BA is worse than a low cost carrier now,Very Negative

672,672,0.158,0.831,0.012,-0.983,One of the worst experiences on the worst airline The flight was delayed due to earlier technical issues The time slipped from 1700 to 2000 to 2200 and finally cancelled There was zero information given Despite paying well over the odds for business class we were booted out of the BA lounge two hours before the flight When it was finally cancelled the BA staff Without explanation told everyone to go to a gate After another hour or so they made us re enter the UK via passport control a further 40 minute wait By now the airport was closing and there was no sign of our bags or any help from BA A passing Gatwick engineer finally helped us locate the bags BA completely washed their hands of us and in contravention of CAA rules refused to find us accommodation Many slept in a bus stop overnight There were people with young children who couldn’t find somewhere to stay and yet BA had closed down and left The following day the replacement flight was also late and due to an admin mistake had no catering or liquids for a 2 12 hr flight Overall the service was shockingly bad the worst I have experienced from any airline I will not ever use them again,Very Negative

670,670,0.121,0.813,0.066,-0.926, The worst journey in my life The connection time at LHR was only 1 hour but the flight from MXP was on delay I had to rush to change terminal by train and arrived risking a heart attack After that the plane just stayed there for another 40 minutes Despite that upon arrival at SJC my baggage was lost I filled the form and gave to the employee I was not given any receipt so I did not have any reference number BA phone number at SJC simply never answer I called twice the toll free number and realized they did not record the delivery address I had to enter myself online dealing with a shitty website They delivered the baggage three days later I claimed for compensation online as I had to buy clothes and other stuff and I did never get a receipt I was expecting an upgrade for the flight back to MXP but nothing happened neither they allowed me to enter BA lounge at SJC Bad customer service The only positive side was price but obviously this cannot justify this treatment and if I knew  I would never flown by BA Never again,Very Negative
658,658,0.105,0.847,0.048,-0.8395,  The already delayed aircraft landed and apart from the small BA logo on the rear of the fuselage there was no indication as to whom the carrier really was Boarding turned into a farce with passenger groups being told to wait in one queue in order to board only to be informed we were on the wrong place and our boarding wasnt allowed yet The interior cabin was reminiscent of a BA cabin from twenty years earlier except the tight legroom and uncomfortable seating which made a budget airline feel luxurious The crew were not BA but from an unknown charter company Service was slow and as usual choices of food to purchase ran out before theyd reached row 24 I requested a cup of tea which never appeared Thank goodness for my airport purchased water and the tiny offering of pretzels The over officious senior flight attendant whod been facilitating in Club Europe appeared in economy and immediately slammed down the armrests whilst still in mid flight making an already uncomfortable journey feel worse Cattle class was definitely that To say I was happy to land and disembark was an understatement Never again BA never again,Very Negative
657,657,0.15,0.767,0.083,-0.9273,  They downgraded me from business to premium economy They took three months to get back to me and offered me 200 pounds or 400 AUD The difference between business class and premium economy which I never fly is 3000 AUD and the difference between economy and business is 6500 AUD They owe me at least 1500 pounds and to be very fair 3250 pounds The downgrade was insulting and incredibly painful as I had a recent cancer operation and have a back injury which I have pointed out to them  I need to lie down The wait for them to get around to me has been numbing The insult of their offer has been the slap in the face to continue my degradation The people I have dealt with at the airport have been down to earth honest hard working people The actual staff on the plane were warm and friendly  and helpful The systems under which BA operates are some sort of medieval torture,Very Negative
654,654,0.081,0.865,0.055,-0.7932,The customer services call centres etc are atrocious and sometimes callous They just don’t care Long waits to speak to anybody who then have no power to actually solve anything and the calls just cut halfway without resolution anyway If the flights are cancelled as were my original ones you’re really left on your own and nobody cares The onboard services are soso but for short haul it’s now “semilow cost” which is confusing as you never know what to expect This time we were given a bottle of water and a very small snack whilst anything else had to be paid for And yet on some other flights apparently you have to preorder any additional food It’s confusing which makes it not dependable Cabin baggage is in theory generous compared to competitors in economy but then they asked more than half the passengers on this flight to check in the cabin baggage at the gate due to lack of space in the overhead cabins leading to long boarding delays Their whole offering hasn’t been thought through very well  The USB power supply did not work throughout the flight contrary to the announcement that the power be available after the seatbelt sight was turned off  so it was pointless providing the sockets in the first place Not my first choice airline on this route and am just trying to use up most of my Avios points before I totally abandon them I fail to see how it is deemed a 4 star airline,Very Negative

651,651,0.096,0.878,0.026,-0.7717,  The flight departed over an hour late due to a late inbound plane The plane was very full and half of the economy class passengers were forced to check in their larger cabin baggage at the gate when boarding making a complete mockery of the hand luggage allowance advertised Lots of passengers on board were stressed out about missing onwards connections due to the delays and some did miss them as their next gates had closed by the time we disembarked at Heathrow Onboard service was ok but minimal   BA gave up being a fullservice airline some time ago More concerning is that trying to get hold of customers services to make changes to bookings and deal with problems was nonexistent The airline seems to make it deliberately hard for its customers to contact it,Very Negative

633,633,0.1,0.834,0.066,-0.8042, 5 days before the flight we were advised by BA that it had been cancelled and asked us to rebook There were flights 1 hour before and 1 hour after our original flight but they made us take one 3 hours earlier Our original ticket and the return flight a week later included a checked bag When we arrive at Heathrow to check in we are told our ticket doesnt included a bag and we will have to pay 75 pounds each to take them We explained that the original ticket had the bags and when they checked the system they confirmed that it did but not this one They would make no effort to sort it out and just told us to pay up or they would remove us from the flight So we had no choice but to pay up thinking it should be pretty easy to get a refund 15 months and 10 emails later we have still not seen a penny Every time I ask where my refund is and state how long we have been waiting I get an inane email saying some departments take longer than others to respond  Absolutely hopeless airline to stuff up the booking in the first place and even worse customer service to not even attempt to solve the problem at check in even when they could see the mistake THEY had made in their system compounded by being be unable to investigate a very simple claim and refund me 150 pounds in 15 months,Very Negative
631,631,0.136,0.783,0.081,-0.85, I recently had a delay on British Airways from BRU to LHR that was due to staff shortages They announced that there was a 2 hour holding delay but they would board us immediately in hopes of clearing the gate and leaving early We had to wait the full 2 hours inside the airplane The plane was old dirty had no power at the seats The staff provided a small bag of pretzels and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight There were no options to purchase food or drink There were no entertainment options available I am a OneWorld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status First class lounges at Heathrow are overcrowded understaffed and poorly equipped The help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations  even when having the top status The Avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket British has lost its way in recent years and has a moved from a worldclass airline to a budget airline with much worse service and timeliness than Ryanair or EasyJet,Very Negative

376,376,0.151,0.802,0.047,-0.958, I fly British Airways weekly not because I want to but because they own the route there’s no other option therefore they frankly don’t have to care about the customer The flights are always delayed and it’s always someone else’s fault be it weather delays to incoming aircraft or flight traffic control issues I’ve heard it all and for the life of me cannot understand why they are allowed to operate I’ve been around the world and traveled with all of the world’s airlines but British Airways are really the worst of the worst It’s such a shame to have watched what used to be a good company fall down a cliff My advice is if you have an option to fly with anyone else then exercise the option but if you’re flying with different connections and you have a tight schedule do not expect BA to get you to your destination in time,Very Negative

354,354,0.081,0.865,0.055,-0.7932,The customer services call centres etc are atrocious and sometimes callous They just don’t care Long waits to speak to anybody who then have no power to actually solve anything and the calls just cut halfway without resolution anyway If the flights are cancelled as were my original ones you’re really left on your own and nobody cares The onboard services are soso but for short haul it’s now “semilow cost” which is confusing as you never know what to expect This time we were given a bottle of water and a very small snack whilst anything else had to be paid for And yet on some other flights apparently you have to preorder any additional food It’s confusing which makes it not dependable Cabin baggage is in theory generous compared to competitors in economy but then they asked more than half the passengers on this flight to check in the cabin baggage at the gate due to lack of space in the overhead cabins leading to long boarding delays Their whole offering hasn’t been thought through very well  The USB power supply did not work throughout the flight contrary to the announcement that the power be available after the seatbelt sight was turned off  so it was pointless providing the sockets in the first place Not my first choice airline on this route and am just trying to use up most of my Avios points before I totally abandon them I fail to see how it is deemed a 4 star airline,Very Negative
428,428,0.132,0.789,0.079,-0.9641,Dear Community I feel compelled to share the utter frustration and disappointment that defined my recent travel experience with British Airways Buckle up folks this ones a rollercoaster On July 16 and 17 2023 I had the displeasure of flying with British Airways on BA709 and BA7 and let me tell you it was a nightmare The initial flight from Zurich ZRH to London LHR on BA709 faced a seemingly unavoidable onehour delay upon arrival at LHR This of course resulted in me missing my connection to Tokyo triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to Tokyo HND via Beijing with Air China Oh but the fun didnt stop there — flight CA183 was also delayed turning my 16hour delay into a grand total of 23 hours finally arriving in Tokyo at 2300 instead of the promised 710 And the cherry on top My four checkedin suitcases decided to take a detour and didnt join me in Tokyo forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the baggage center I finally got my lost luggage back on July 23 because why make it easy right But wait theres more My return flight from Tokyo to Zurich BA8 on August 8 also danced to the delay tune making me question if punctuality is just a myth for British Airways The cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans stealing a whole day of scheduled activities including a guided Tokyo tour As if that werent enough I had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expenses—extra airport transfers tour operator assistance fees emergency purchases airport meals and international calls for rearrangements The lack of assistance at LHR airport was the icing on this bitter cake Installing the BA app just to get basic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle and the fact that no BA clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating British Airways youve left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet Heres hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now its not a good look Frustrated and fed up Bert,Very Negative
431,431,0.136,0.783,0.081,-0.85, I recently had a delay on British Airways from BRU to LHR that was due to staff shortages They announced that there was a 2 hour holding delay but they would board us immediately in hopes of clearing the gate and leaving early We had to wait the full 2 hours inside the airplane The plane was old dirty had no power at the seats The staff provided a small bag of pretzels and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight There were no options to purchase food or drink There were no entertainment options available I am a OneWorld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status First class lounges at Heathrow are overcrowded understaffed and poorly equipped The help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations  even when having the top status The Avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket British has lost its way in recent years and has a moved from a worldclass airline to a budget airline with much worse service and timeliness than Ryanair or EasyJet,Very Negative
505,505,0.151,0.821,0.028,-0.9643, Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled thanks to strong tail winds The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks Nothing at all available to even buy to eat Worse than a lowcost carrier experience in this sense One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passengers head for the whole flight poor maintenance of cabin I would choose another airline on this route in the future as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin,Very Negative

458,458,0.105,0.847,0.048,-0.8395,  The already delayed aircraft landed and apart from the small BA logo on the rear of the fuselage there was no indication as to whom the carrier really was Boarding turned into a farce with passenger groups being told to wait in one queue in order to board only to be informed we were on the wrong place and our boarding wasnt allowed yet The interior cabin was reminiscent of a BA cabin from twenty years earlier except the tight legroom and uncomfortable seating which made a budget airline feel luxurious The crew were not BA but from an unknown charter company Service was slow and as usual choices of food to purchase ran out before theyd reached row 24 I requested a cup of tea which never appeared Thank goodness for my airport purchased water and the tiny offering of pretzels The over officious senior flight attendant whod been facilitating in Club Europe appeared in economy and immediately slammed down the armrests whilst still in mid flight making an already uncomfortable journey feel worse Cattle class was definitely that To say I was happy to land and disembark was an understatement Never again BA never again,Very Negative

2096,2096,0.088,0.875,0.036,-0.8793, I flew London to Malaga on 27 August in Club Europe We stood around at Gate B45 in Terminal 5 for over an hour with staff giving very different reasons for the delay late inbound aircraft etc  but the plane we boarded had been sitting there for more than an hour After boarding the captain stated that because they had changed planes there would be no meals served This is Club Europe and we received one small packet of crisps throughout the flight No effort to apologise We smelt the hot meal for pilots being heated and then saw it being served to them on a Club Europe meal tray Cabin crew also had warmed pastries  and were very quick to use air freshener in the front galley while customers received zilch BA sent an email the following morning to say sorry  nothing else What a complete and utter rip off by an airline that is already cutting back on so many things I paid a full Business class fare did not receive any part of the onboard meal service and they expect an email to be sufficient Avoid BA if you have any other option nowadays they are the worst in Europe,Very Negative
2093,2093,0.142,0.808,0.051,-0.931, British Airways absolutely does not care My reserved seat was change from an aisle to center seat for this overnight full flight and it was quite awful After enquiring at LAX check in the agent said sorry nothing we can do Onboard the flight the attendants seemed to try and finish the meal service at a racing speed with meals trays passed out with no proper questions about choice Then back and clearing trays and they disappeared to rest in the kitchen for hours after that No water runs if you need anything do not bother with the call bell as they simply ignore it I used to like travelling British Airways 1015 years ago but the bean counters have been in and lowered it close to a lowcost carrier I guess staff are badly paid from their terrible attitude and service My last trip to London was with Delta they are so much better than this very poor excuse of an airline that British Air has now become,Very Negative
2092,2092,0.157,0.758,0.085,-0.9475, Flying A380 business class should be a pleasure but BA has made it a disaster with the worst seating and configuration imaginable How could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy Seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised The Tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position There is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping  The window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of The whole business class set up is a sick joke Eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off Are there any redeeming features  the answer is no If you like a little comfort avoid BA like the plague,Very Negative
2088,2088,0.085,0.851,0.064,-0.8095, British Airways has a total lack of respect for its customers I was booked to fly from Frankfurt Main to London City Airport and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by BA without explanation when I was already at the airport The worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers The ground staff’s attitude was that they are merely third party agents not BA employees and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all telling us we had to contact BA directly via phone if we wanted help They couldn’t even provide us a phone number telling us to look it up on bacom  So BA abandoned its passengers They did tell us that the BA departure to Heathrow had also been cancelled meaning there would be no further BA flight from Frankfurt to London that day although other airlines were still operating the route but BA refused to rebook us on them The reason given for both cancellations was “technical reasons” No assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation nor any information on help regarding food accommodation help etc Their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem not theirs I received an email an hour later notifying me that I had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later which wasn’t acceptable as I had to get back to London that night I rang BA’s call centre and again they showed a high degree of callousness 95 of the halfhour call was spent with me waiting on hold with the phone just cutting off after half an hour and no meaningful information given to me by that point There was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut and I had a solid phone signal and wifi as I was still standing in Terminal 2 of Frankfurt Main airport even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details They just don’t care In the end I had to arrange my own return to London by taking a coach to Hanh airport which was 112km away  waiting there for 5 hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with Ryanair to Stansted At least that flight operated on time and got me back to London BA is worse than a low cost carrier now,Very Negative

2083,2083,0.142,0.811,0.046,-0.9877, My daughter and I were denied boarding on our business class flight from Madrid to Heathrow in March 25 2023 the first leg on our return flight to Victoria Canada No reason was given for the denied boarding by the check in staff at the British Airways counter in Madrid who said they were only agents and told us to call British Airways We were three hours early for the flight and had valid passports After many tries we finally reached British Airways by phone but we were told to call Expedia which had booked the flights Expedia confirmed that we had been bumped from the flight with no explanation as to why Expedia then began a long process of finding alternative flights Over the next 24 hours we had numerous calls with both Expedia and British Airways Incredibly the next available flights were 9 days later on April 3 This was almost unbelievable but after many many tries it was the best we could do Even though these were Business Class tickets Part of the problem was that apparently rules did not allow any changes to routing for any segment of the flight This nine day delay was a major problem for us I had to miss work and my daughter was missing school Further we received no compensation from British Airways no penalty fee and not any reimbursement of our expenses for staying the nine extra days After our return I began the British Airways online complaint process and submitted all supporting documents I received an email reply and a case reference number And then nothing I sent numerous follow up emails and received no replies It is now months later and still I have not heard from British Airways This is shocking and definitely the worst airline service I have received for my thousands of flights over many decades I am a very patient person and this is the first time I have commented on this type of forum I think the public should be made aware of extremely poor customer service at British Airways,Very Negative
2078,2078,0.106,0.863,0.031,-0.8481,Not    My initial flight was cancelled 8 hours prior the flight Then I was automatically rescheduled for next day Next day the flight was delayed leaving Hamburg and missed my connecting flight to Las Vegas Me and several other passengers spent the night in London British Airways provided us with vouchers but the transfer bus dropped us at the wrong hotel closest to our hotel and told us that we can walk there if we want to As a result I lost two nights hotel reservations that I made in las Vegas I opened a claim and provided all receipts to British Airways to get refund of my hotel reservations but over 5 weeks now not a single feedback from British Airways I will avoid all flights with them in future and will share this story,Very Negative
2077,2077,0.144,0.773,0.084,-0.9635,Not    Everything was ok until our connecting flight in London just before take off we were on the runway the pilot came on to announce an engine problem After engineers tried to fix it while we waited on the plane for over an hour we were finally told that we would have to be evacuated and rebooked for another flight but not to worry because a special crew was waiting for us on the ground to help us and set us up in a hotel except that there was no one to help us In fact everyone refused to help us It was Saturday almost 8pm and they just wanted to go home Anyone with a connecting flight couldnt rebook on the application because the app wouldnt disassociate our first flight with the connecting one in London and the staff saw this but still refused to help us They gave us a phone number but there was only a message that said just to use the app Finally I got someone on the phone who rebooked us for the next day Now its 1030pm and I have to find a hotel room because the airline refused also to help us with that So i had 2 choices either sleep in the airport or pay over 700GBP for a room I dont have the money to pay for this but after a 10 hour flight 8 hours of jet lag and the insane stress after the fact that no one from British Airways would help us I took the room Of course I claimed reimbursement but that was over 3 weeks ago and I havent heard anything since so I have no idea when or how much Ill be reimbursed even though Im not claiming any emotional compensation from the horrible situation they put me through due to their total indifference Its financially difficult for me right now because the money I had to put out is equal to half my salary and of course its impossible to reach them by phone I feel still as i did on August 26 2023 completely trapped by them and their indifference with no solution or information,Very Negative
2076,2076,0.151,0.802,0.047,-0.958, I fly British Airways weekly not because I want to but because they own the route there’s no other option therefore they frankly don’t have to care about the customer The flights are always delayed and it’s always someone else’s fault be it weather delays to incoming aircraft or flight traffic control issues I’ve heard it all and for the life of me cannot understand why they are allowed to operate I’ve been around the world and traveled with all of the world’s airlines but British Airways are really the worst of the worst It’s such a shame to have watched what used to be a good company fall down a cliff My advice is if you have an option to fly with anyone else then exercise the option but if you’re flying with different connections and you have a tight schedule do not expect BA to get you to your destination in time,Very Negative
2154,2154,0.081,0.865,0.055,-0.7932,The customer services call centres etc are atrocious and sometimes callous They just don’t care Long waits to speak to anybody who then have no power to actually solve anything and the calls just cut halfway without resolution anyway If the flights are cancelled as were my original ones you’re really left on your own and nobody cares The onboard services are soso but for short haul it’s now “semilow cost” which is confusing as you never know what to expect This time we were given a bottle of water and a very small snack whilst anything else had to be paid for And yet on some other flights apparently you have to preorder any additional food It’s confusing which makes it not dependable Cabin baggage is in theory generous compared to competitors in economy but then they asked more than half the passengers on this flight to check in the cabin baggage at the gate due to lack of space in the overhead cabins leading to long boarding delays Their whole offering hasn’t been thought through very well  The USB power supply did not work throughout the flight contrary to the announcement that the power be available after the seatbelt sight was turned off  so it was pointless providing the sockets in the first place Not my first choice airline on this route and am just trying to use up most of my Avios points before I totally abandon them I fail to see how it is deemed a 4 star airline,Very Negative
2157,2157,0.15,0.767,0.083,-0.9273,  They downgraded me from business to premium economy They took three months to get back to me and offered me 200 pounds or 400 AUD The difference between business class and premium economy which I never fly is 3000 AUD and the difference between economy and business is 6500 AUD They owe me at least 1500 pounds and to be very fair 3250 pounds The downgrade was insulting and incredibly painful as I had a recent cancer operation and have a back injury which I have pointed out to them  I need to lie down The wait for them to get around to me has been numbing The insult of their offer has been the slap in the face to continue my degradation The people I have dealt with at the airport have been down to earth honest hard working people The actual staff on the plane were warm and friendly  and helpful The systems under which BA operates are some sort of medieval torture,Very Negative
2158,2158,0.105,0.847,0.048,-0.8395,  The already delayed aircraft landed and apart from the small BA logo on the rear of the fuselage there was no indication as to whom the carrier really was Boarding turned into a farce with passenger groups being told to wait in one queue in order to board only to be informed we were on the wrong place and our boarding wasnt allowed yet The interior cabin was reminiscent of a BA cabin from twenty years earlier except the tight legroom and uncomfortable seating which made a budget airline feel luxurious The crew were not BA but from an unknown charter company Service was slow and as usual choices of food to purchase ran out before theyd reached row 24 I requested a cup of tea which never appeared Thank goodness for my airport purchased water and the tiny offering of pretzels The over officious senior flight attendant whod been facilitating in Club Europe appeared in economy and immediately slammed down the armrests whilst still in mid flight making an already uncomfortable journey feel worse Cattle class was definitely that To say I was happy to land and disembark was an understatement Never again BA never again,Very Negative
2170,2170,0.121,0.813,0.066,-0.926, The worst journey in my life The connection time at LHR was only 1 hour but the flight from MXP was on delay I had to rush to change terminal by train and arrived risking a heart attack After that the plane just stayed there for another 40 minutes Despite that upon arrival at SJC my baggage was lost I filled the form and gave to the employee I was not given any receipt so I did not have any reference number BA phone number at SJC simply never answer I called twice the toll free number and realized they did not record the delivery address I had to enter myself online dealing with a shitty website They delivered the baggage three days later I claimed for compensation online as I had to buy clothes and other stuff and I did never get a receipt I was expecting an upgrade for the flight back to MXP but nothing happened neither they allowed me to enter BA lounge at SJC Bad customer service The only positive side was price but obviously this cannot justify this treatment and if I knew  I would never flown by BA Never again,Very Negative
2233,2233,0.1,0.834,0.066,-0.8042, 5 days before the flight we were advised by BA that it had been cancelled and asked us to rebook There were flights 1 hour before and 1 hour after our original flight but they made us take one 3 hours earlier Our original ticket and the return flight a week later included a checked bag When we arrive at Heathrow to check in we are told our ticket doesnt included a bag and we will have to pay 75 pounds each to take them We explained that the original ticket had the bags and when they checked the system they confirmed that it did but not this one They would make no effort to sort it out and just told us to pay up or they would remove us from the flight So we had no choice but to pay up thinking it should be pretty easy to get a refund 15 months and 10 emails later we have still not seen a penny Every time I ask where my refund is and state how long we have been waiting I get an inane email saying some departments take longer than others to respond  Absolutely hopeless airline to stuff up the booking in the first place and even worse customer service to not even attempt to solve the problem at check in even when they could see the mistake THEY had made in their system compounded by being be unable to investigate a very simple claim and refund me 150 pounds in 15 months,Very Negative
2231,2231,0.136,0.783,0.081,-0.85, I recently had a delay on British Airways from BRU to LHR that was due to staff shortages They announced that there was a 2 hour holding delay but they would board us immediately in hopes of clearing the gate and leaving early We had to wait the full 2 hours inside the airplane The plane was old dirty had no power at the seats The staff provided a small bag of pretzels and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight There were no options to purchase food or drink There were no entertainment options available I am a OneWorld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status First class lounges at Heathrow are overcrowded understaffed and poorly equipped The help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations  even when having the top status The Avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket British has lost its way in recent years and has a moved from a worldclass airline to a budget airline with much worse service and timeliness than Ryanair or EasyJet,Very Negative

2193,2193,0.142,0.808,0.051,-0.931, British Airways absolutely does not care My reserved seat was change from an aisle to center seat for this overnight full flight and it was quite awful After enquiring at LAX check in the agent said sorry nothing we can do Onboard the flight the attendants seemed to try and finish the meal service at a racing speed with meals trays passed out with no proper questions about choice Then back and clearing trays and they disappeared to rest in the kitchen for hours after that No water runs if you need anything do not bother with the call bell as they simply ignore it I used to like travelling British Airways 1015 years ago but the bean counters have been in and lowered it close to a lowcost carrier I guess staff are badly paid from their terrible attitude and service My last trip to London was with Delta they are so much better than this very poor excuse of an airline that British Air has now become,Very Negative
2192,2192,0.157,0.758,0.085,-0.9475, Flying A380 business class should be a pleasure but BA has made it a disaster with the worst seating and configuration imaginable How could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy Seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised The Tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position There is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping  The window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of The whole business class set up is a sick joke Eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off Are there any redeeming features  the answer is no If you like a little comfort avoid BA like the plague,Very Negative
2188,2188,0.085,0.851,0.064,-0.8095, British Airways has a total lack of respect for its customers I was booked to fly from Frankfurt Main to London City Airport and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by BA without explanation when I was already at the airport The worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers The ground staff’s attitude was that they are merely third party agents not BA employees and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all telling us we had to contact BA directly via phone if we wanted help They couldn’t even provide us a phone number telling us to look it up on bacom  So BA abandoned its passengers They did tell us that the BA departure to Heathrow had also been cancelled meaning there would be no further BA flight from Frankfurt to London that day although other airlines were still operating the route but BA refused to rebook us on them The reason given for both cancellations was “technical reasons” No assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation nor any information on help regarding food accommodation help etc Their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem not theirs I received an email an hour later notifying me that I had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later which wasn’t acceptable as I had to get back to London that night I rang BA’s call centre and again they showed a high degree of callousness 95 of the halfhour call was spent with me waiting on hold with the phone just cutting off after half an hour and no meaningful information given to me by that point There was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut and I had a solid phone signal and wifi as I was still standing in Terminal 2 of Frankfurt Main airport even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details They just don’t care In the end I had to arrange my own return to London by taking a coach to Hanh airport which was 112km away  waiting there for 5 hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with Ryanair to Stansted At least that flight operated on time and got me back to London BA is worse than a low cost carrier now,Very Negative

2176,2176,0.151,0.802,0.047,-0.958, I fly British Airways weekly not because I want to but because they own the route there’s no other option therefore they frankly don’t have to care about the customer The flights are always delayed and it’s always someone else’s fault be it weather delays to incoming aircraft or flight traffic control issues I’ve heard it all and for the life of me cannot understand why they are allowed to operate I’ve been around the world and traveled with all of the world’s airlines but British Airways are really the worst of the worst It’s such a shame to have watched what used to be a good company fall down a cliff My advice is if you have an option to fly with anyone else then exercise the option but if you’re flying with different connections and you have a tight schedule do not expect BA to get you to your destination in time,Very Negative
2175,2175,0.129,0.84,0.03,-0.9747, We started our day with BA in Prague The flight actually left on time I came to find out that’s very unusual We purchased business class seats As you can see from the picture they hardly were business class All they did was block off the middle seat in the first few rows and called it business class Horrible flight In addition I had a really rude rude check in clerk basically yell at me when I excused myself and asked if she could give a little bit of priority to the many business class passengers who weren’t being served Then we got to Heathrow and the real fun began We had a 4 hour delay They gave us about 5 different excuses for the delay I had a few employees walk away while I was asking them questions They were very rude At one point there were no employees left And from the announcements it seems virtually every BA flight was delayed And there were no weather issues There was no place to comfortably store items in business class I’ve never experienced that before Not even a cup holder for my bottle of water The seat controls didn’t work well You had to keep pushing the buttons to get them to do anything The power outlet didn’t work There was no internet the entire flight The overhead luggage bin was too heavy I almost got a hernia having to close it This is a horrible airline I’ll never fly with them again If I could give zero stars I would,Very Negative
2174,2174,0.066,0.907,0.027,-0.8689,I had a flight from Miami Florida to Dublin Ireland via Londons Heathrow airport The outbound flight from Miami was delayed and we were further delayed when our gate was occupied when we arrived in Heathrow The total delay was roughly an hour but it was enough to make our connection a challenge where we had 73 minutes between original arrival time until the departure time to Dublin When we headed to our connection flight we were stopped by security personnel at a checkpoint and told us that the gate to our connection flight had already closed This was twenty minutes prior to departure time They ushered us to customer service to be rebooked Given the busy weekend of travel we were rebooked on a flight at a different airport and were told that our cost to get there would be reimbursed We then waited 3 hours for our luggage and then took a cab to Londons City Airport The cab fare was roughly 500 When I filed a claim with British Airways they refused the claim and told me that we had plenty of time to make our connecting flight and therefore they denied my claim to be reimbursed for the cab fare This is after I explained that it was British Airways employees who ushered us to rebook the flight despite the 20 minute timeframe to make the connecting flight The person who rebooked us told us it was policy that they close the gate 20 minutes prior to departure I will never fly this awful airline again Given the other feedback on this site it appears that that is the overwhelming sentiment,Very Negative

2611,2611,0.14,0.767,0.093,-0.8855,I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways specifically regarding their customer service After my initial flight leg was canceled I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes Realizing the impracticality of this I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 34 hours Shockingly the customer support representative flatly refused citing an inability to change my flight Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures I received no assistance To add to the frustration the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation Moreover the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India allegedly contributing to the subpar service This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future The lack of assistance blameshifting and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service,Very Negative

2593,2593,0.142,0.808,0.051,-0.931, British Airways absolutely does not care My reserved seat was change from an aisle to center seat for this overnight full flight and it was quite awful After enquiring at LAX check in the agent said sorry nothing we can do Onboard the flight the attendants seemed to try and finish the meal service at a racing speed with meals trays passed out with no proper questions about choice Then back and clearing trays and they disappeared to rest in the kitchen for hours after that No water runs if you need anything do not bother with the call bell as they simply ignore it I used to like travelling British Airways 1015 years ago but the bean counters have been in and lowered it close to a lowcost carrier I guess staff are badly paid from their terrible attitude and service My last trip to London was with Delta they are so much better than this very poor excuse of an airline that British Air has now become,Very Negative

2674,2674,0.066,0.907,0.027,-0.8689,I had a flight from Miami Florida to Dublin Ireland via Londons Heathrow airport The outbound flight from Miami was delayed and we were further delayed when our gate was occupied when we arrived in Heathrow The total delay was roughly an hour but it was enough to make our connection a challenge where we had 73 minutes between original arrival time until the departure time to Dublin When we headed to our connection flight we were stopped by security personnel at a checkpoint and told us that the gate to our connection flight had already closed This was twenty minutes prior to departure time They ushered us to customer service to be rebooked Given the busy weekend of travel we were rebooked on a flight at a different airport and were told that our cost to get there would be reimbursed We then waited 3 hours for our luggage and then took a cab to Londons City Airport The cab fare was roughly 500 When I filed a claim with British Airways they refused the claim and told me that we had plenty of time to make our connecting flight and therefore they denied my claim to be reimbursed for the cab fare This is after I explained that it was British Airways employees who ushered us to rebook the flight despite the 20 minute timeframe to make the connecting flight The person who rebooked us told us it was policy that they close the gate 20 minutes prior to departure I will never fly this awful airline again Given the other feedback on this site it appears that that is the overwhelming sentiment,Very Negative

2676,2676,0.151,0.802,0.047,-0.958, I fly British Airways weekly not because I want to but because they own the route there’s no other option therefore they frankly don’t have to care about the customer The flights are always delayed and it’s always someone else’s fault be it weather delays to incoming aircraft or flight traffic control issues I’ve heard it all and for the life of me cannot understand why they are allowed to operate I’ve been around the world and traveled with all of the world’s airlines but British Airways are really the worst of the worst It’s such a shame to have watched what used to be a good company fall down a cliff My advice is if you have an option to fly with anyone else then exercise the option but if you’re flying with different connections and you have a tight schedule do not expect BA to get you to your destination in time,Very Negative

2718,2718,0.131,0.853,0.016,-0.9465,Once again a terrible business class experience with BA The flight was delayed by 45 hours The plane was very old with problems with at least 4 of the seats in business class not cleaned properly prior to departure Food was terrible as always with BA and only one choice available from advertised menu As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from Heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day  which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional 4 hour delay whilst at Heathrow At no point were we advised about our compensation rights despite asking at check in and connections or provided any vouchers during the delays Having flown Etihad Qatar and Virgin business class equivalents over the last year it is clear to see how big the gulf now is between BA and its rivals ,Very Negative
2716,2716,0.149,0.819,0.031,-0.9751, I was going to fly to Frankfurt from Glasgow over London but the flight from London to Frankfurt was cancelled This meant I had to stay overnight in London where I have no accommodation etc As I was rebooked to a flight from London City airport which was more than 2h by train I had to get an uber and then take a hotel for £250 in total London prices I was reassured over the phone that I would get all the money back My flight from London city airport was then cancelled again and rebooked to London Heathrow but two days later I then cancelled that flight and rebooked a new one with Lufthansa as I urgently had to get to work and needed the money I never received the money back for the hotel compensation for cancelled flight 1 compensation for cancelled flight 2 the extra food I had to pay for the uber or the actual cost of the flight I was first transferred 3€ by British Airways They stopped replying to me and told me the issue was weather conditions although other nonBA flights were going I lost over £700 in total and never got compensated for the loss of a work day either It just really feels like they dont care about people Worst serviceairline ever,Very Negative

2711,2711,0.14,0.767,0.093,-0.8855,I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways specifically regarding their customer service After my initial flight leg was canceled I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes Realizing the impracticality of this I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 34 hours Shockingly the customer support representative flatly refused citing an inability to change my flight Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures I received no assistance To add to the frustration the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation Moreover the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India allegedly contributing to the subpar service This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future The lack of assistance blameshifting and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service,Very Negative

1711,1711,0.14,0.767,0.093,-0.8855,I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways specifically regarding their customer service After my initial flight leg was canceled I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes Realizing the impracticality of this I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 34 hours Shockingly the customer support representative flatly refused citing an inability to change my flight Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures I received no assistance To add to the frustration the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation Moreover the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India allegedly contributing to the subpar service This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future The lack of assistance blameshifting and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service,Very Negative

1393,1393,0.142,0.808,0.051,-0.931, British Airways absolutely does not care My reserved seat was change from an aisle to center seat for this overnight full flight and it was quite awful After enquiring at LAX check in the agent said sorry nothing we can do Onboard the flight the attendants seemed to try and finish the meal service at a racing speed with meals trays passed out with no proper questions about choice Then back and clearing trays and they disappeared to rest in the kitchen for hours after that No water runs if you need anything do not bother with the call bell as they simply ignore it I used to like travelling British Airways 1015 years ago but the bean counters have been in and lowered it close to a lowcost carrier I guess staff are badly paid from their terrible attitude and service My last trip to London was with Delta they are so much better than this very poor excuse of an airline that British Air has now become,Very Negative
1392,1392,0.157,0.758,0.085,-0.9475, Flying A380 business class should be a pleasure but BA has made it a disaster with the worst seating and configuration imaginable How could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy Seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised The Tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position There is no where to put anything except one small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping  The window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to get out of The whole business class set up is a sick joke Eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off Are there any redeeming features  the answer is no If you like a little comfort avoid BA like the plague,Very Negative
1388,1388,0.085,0.851,0.064,-0.8095, British Airways has a total lack of respect for its customers I was booked to fly from Frankfurt Main to London City Airport and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by BA without explanation when I was already at the airport The worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers The ground staff’s attitude was that they are merely third party agents not BA employees and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all telling us we had to contact BA directly via phone if we wanted help They couldn’t even provide us a phone number telling us to look it up on bacom  So BA abandoned its passengers They did tell us that the BA departure to Heathrow had also been cancelled meaning there would be no further BA flight from Frankfurt to London that day although other airlines were still operating the route but BA refused to rebook us on them The reason given for both cancellations was “technical reasons” No assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation nor any information on help regarding food accommodation help etc Their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem not theirs I received an email an hour later notifying me that I had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later which wasn’t acceptable as I had to get back to London that night I rang BA’s call centre and again they showed a high degree of callousness 95 of the halfhour call was spent with me waiting on hold with the phone just cutting off after half an hour and no meaningful information given to me by that point There was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut and I had a solid phone signal and wifi as I was still standing in Terminal 2 of Frankfurt Main airport even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details They just don’t care In the end I had to arrange my own return to London by taking a coach to Hanh airport which was 112km away  waiting there for 5 hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with Ryanair to Stansted At least that flight operated on time and got me back to London BA is worse than a low cost carrier now,Very Negative

1472,1472,0.158,0.831,0.012,-0.983,One of the worst experiences on the worst airline The flight was delayed due to earlier technical issues The time slipped from 1700 to 2000 to 2200 and finally cancelled There was zero information given Despite paying well over the odds for business class we were booted out of the BA lounge two hours before the flight When it was finally cancelled the BA staff Without explanation told everyone to go to a gate After another hour or so they made us re enter the UK via passport control a further 40 minute wait By now the airport was closing and there was no sign of our bags or any help from BA A passing Gatwick engineer finally helped us locate the bags BA completely washed their hands of us and in contravention of CAA rules refused to find us accommodation Many slept in a bus stop overnight There were people with young children who couldn’t find somewhere to stay and yet BA had closed down and left The following day the replacement flight was also late and due to an admin mistake had no catering or liquids for a 2 12 hr flight Overall the service was shockingly bad the worst I have experienced from any airline I will not ever use them again,Very Negative
1551,1551,0.096,0.878,0.026,-0.7717,  The flight departed over an hour late due to a late inbound plane The plane was very full and half of the economy class passengers were forced to check in their larger cabin baggage at the gate when boarding making a complete mockery of the hand luggage allowance advertised Lots of passengers on board were stressed out about missing onwards connections due to the delays and some did miss them as their next gates had closed by the time we disembarked at Heathrow Onboard service was ok but minimal   BA gave up being a fullservice airline some time ago More concerning is that trying to get hold of customers services to make changes to bookings and deal with problems was nonexistent The airline seems to make it deliberately hard for its customers to contact it,Very Negative
1474,1474,0.066,0.907,0.027,-0.8689,I had a flight from Miami Florida to Dublin Ireland via Londons Heathrow airport The outbound flight from Miami was delayed and we were further delayed when our gate was occupied when we arrived in Heathrow The total delay was roughly an hour but it was enough to make our connection a challenge where we had 73 minutes between original arrival time until the departure time to Dublin When we headed to our connection flight we were stopped by security personnel at a checkpoint and told us that the gate to our connection flight had already closed This was twenty minutes prior to departure time They ushered us to customer service to be rebooked Given the busy weekend of travel we were rebooked on a flight at a different airport and were told that our cost to get there would be reimbursed We then waited 3 hours for our luggage and then took a cab to Londons City Airport The cab fare was roughly 500 When I filed a claim with British Airways they refused the claim and told me that we had plenty of time to make our connecting flight and therefore they denied my claim to be reimbursed for the cab fare This is after I explained that it was British Airways employees who ushered us to rebook the flight despite the 20 minute timeframe to make the connecting flight The person who rebooked us told us it was policy that they close the gate 20 minutes prior to departure I will never fly this awful airline again Given the other feedback on this site it appears that that is the overwhelming sentiment,Very Negative

1911,1911,0.14,0.767,0.093,-0.8855,I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways specifically regarding their customer service After my initial flight leg was canceled I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes Realizing the impracticality of this I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 34 hours Shockingly the customer support representative flatly refused citing an inability to change my flight Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures I received no assistance To add to the frustration the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation Moreover the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India allegedly contributing to the subpar service This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future The lack of assistance blameshifting and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service,Very Negative

2016,2016,0.149,0.819,0.031,-0.9751, I was going to fly to Frankfurt from Glasgow over London but the flight from London to Frankfurt was cancelled This meant I had to stay overnight in London where I have no accommodation etc As I was rebooked to a flight from London City airport which was more than 2h by train I had to get an uber and then take a hotel for £250 in total London prices I was reassured over the phone that I would get all the money back My flight from London city airport was then cancelled again and rebooked to London Heathrow but two days later I then cancelled that flight and rebooked a new one with Lufthansa as I urgently had to get to work and needed the money I never received the money back for the hotel compensation for cancelled flight 1 compensation for cancelled flight 2 the extra food I had to pay for the uber or the actual cost of the flight I was first transferred 3€ by British Airways They stopped replying to me and told me the issue was weather conditions although other nonBA flights were going I lost over £700 in total and never got compensated for the loss of a work day either It just really feels like they dont care about people Worst serviceairline ever,Very Negative
2012,2012,0.124,0.859,0.017,-0.9359,Not    Beware BA dont provide any refund due to a very serious medical reason My father was diagnosed with a severe heart defect a couple of weeks before his flight date and BA refused to give any refund as this was not a good enough reason We sent them a medical note from his doctor saying he is unfit to travel due to potential heart failure and needs to have heart surgery as soon as possible and the operator totally dismissed it They said only thing they can do is change the travel date within a year Heart surgery recovery takes months and its highly unlikely that he will be able to travel within the year meaning he would lose his ticket and money They said they cant do anything to help not even change the name on the ticket so someone else can use the tickets The most ridiculous thing Ive heard,Very Negative
2011,2011,0.14,0.767,0.093,-0.8855,I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways specifically regarding their customer service After my initial flight leg was canceled I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes Realizing the impracticality of this I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 34 hours Shockingly the customer support representative flatly refused citing an inability to change my flight Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures I received no assistance To add to the frustration the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation Moreover the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India allegedly contributing to the subpar service This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future The lack of assistance blameshifting and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service,Very Negative
2005,2005,0.151,0.821,0.028,-0.9643, Flight left on time and arrived over half an hour earlier than scheduled thanks to strong tail winds The flight was full but no catering had been loaded for economy passenger at Heathrow so for 3 and a half hours we only had a small bottle of water and a small packet of corn snacks Nothing at all available to even buy to eat Worse than a lowcost carrier experience in this sense One of the light panels overhead the seats towards the back of the plan was broken and loose and just hanging above the unfortunate passengers head for the whole flight poor maintenance of cabin I would choose another airline on this route in the future as one of their competitors offers full meal service on this route even in the economy cabin,Very Negative

1776,1776,0.151,0.802,0.047,-0.958, I fly British Airways weekly not because I want to but because they own the route there’s no other option therefore they frankly don’t have to care about the customer The flights are always delayed and it’s always someone else’s fault be it weather delays to incoming aircraft or flight traffic control issues I’ve heard it all and for the life of me cannot understand why they are allowed to operate I’ve been around the world and traveled with all of the world’s airlines but British Airways are really the worst of the worst It’s such a shame to have watched what used to be a good company fall down a cliff My advice is if you have an option to fly with anyone else then exercise the option but if you’re flying with different connections and you have a tight schedule do not expect BA to get you to your destination in time,Very Negative

1774,1774,0.066,0.907,0.027,-0.8689,I had a flight from Miami Florida to Dublin Ireland via Londons Heathrow airport The outbound flight from Miami was delayed and we were further delayed when our gate was occupied when we arrived in Heathrow The total delay was roughly an hour but it was enough to make our connection a challenge where we had 73 minutes between original arrival time until the departure time to Dublin When we headed to our connection flight we were stopped by security personnel at a checkpoint and told us that the gate to our connection flight had already closed This was twenty minutes prior to departure time They ushered us to customer service to be rebooked Given the busy weekend of travel we were rebooked on a flight at a different airport and were told that our cost to get there would be reimbursed We then waited 3 hours for our luggage and then took a cab to Londons City Airport The cab fare was roughly 500 When I filed a claim with British Airways they refused the claim and told me that we had plenty of time to make our connecting flight and therefore they denied my claim to be reimbursed for the cab fare This is after I explained that it was British Airways employees who ushered us to rebook the flight despite the 20 minute timeframe to make the connecting flight The person who rebooked us told us it was policy that they close the gate 20 minutes prior to departure I will never fly this awful airline again Given the other feedback on this site it appears that that is the overwhelming sentiment,Very Negative

1888,1888,0.085,0.851,0.064,-0.8095, British Airways has a total lack of respect for its customers I was booked to fly from Frankfurt Main to London City Airport and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by BA without explanation when I was already at the airport The worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers The ground staff’s attitude was that they are merely third party agents not BA employees and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all telling us we had to contact BA directly via phone if we wanted help They couldn’t even provide us a phone number telling us to look it up on bacom  So BA abandoned its passengers They did tell us that the BA departure to Heathrow had also been cancelled meaning there would be no further BA flight from Frankfurt to London that day although other airlines were still operating the route but BA refused to rebook us on them The reason given for both cancellations was “technical reasons” No assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation nor any information on help regarding food accommodation help etc Their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem not theirs I received an email an hour later notifying me that I had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later which wasn’t acceptable as I had to get back to London that night I rang BA’s call centre and again they showed a high degree of callousness 95 of the halfhour call was spent with me waiting on hold with the phone just cutting off after half an hour and no meaningful information given to me by that point There was no attempt by the call operator to call me back when the line cut and I had a solid phone signal and wifi as I was still standing in Terminal 2 of Frankfurt Main airport even though my phone number is listed in my booking contact details They just don’t care In the end I had to arrange my own return to London by taking a coach to Hanh airport which was 112km away  waiting there for 5 hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with Ryanair to Stansted At least that flight operated on time and got me back to London BA is worse than a low cost carrier now,Very Negative
1811,1811,0.14,0.767,0.093,-0.8855,I recently encountered a highly disappointing experience with British Airways specifically regarding their customer service After my initial flight leg was canceled I was rebooked with a connection at London Heathrow reduced to a mere 1 hour and 30 minutes Realizing the impracticality of this I promptly contacted British Airways within 10 minutes to request a more reasonable layover of 34 hours Shockingly the customer support representative flatly refused citing an inability to change my flight Despite explaining the logistical challenges of a short layover and a terminal change requiring additional security procedures I received no assistance To add to the frustration the representative inaccurately noted on my account that I was presented with multiple options during our conversation Moreover the use of military time format and the lack of initial options provided only exacerbated the communication issues Both phone and email support proved equally incompetent and I was informed that customer service is outsourced to India allegedly contributing to the subpar service This experience has left me not only struggling to rebook my flight but also with a strong resolve to avoid British Airways in the future The lack of assistance blameshifting and overall incompetence in customer service make it my worst experience yet I strongly advise others to steer clear of British Airways and their appalling customer service,Very Negative

1845,1845,0.205,0.758,0.037,-0.9862,Not    Absolutely the worst experience ever  Flew into Heathrow no problem Waited for 5 hours three extra hours for our connection to Porto then the cancelled the flight Scrambled for a hotel and a new flight the next day They routed us through Madrid the next morning That flight was 15 hours late so we missed our connection to Porto Because we missed the connection their fault they cancelled our return flights After two hours on the phone with customer service from the Madrid airport they booked us a new return flight then they made is pay  1300 to fly from Madrid to Porto Then for no reason they cancelled our return flight again After hours and hours and hours with customer service we finally got a return flight five days after our original return flight Meanwhile they lost my wifes luggage We finally got 15 DAYS after they lost it Return flight More problems with our reservations At no point was British Airways helpful They left the onus on us to fix their mistakes at every turn They completely ruined a three week vacation and they dont care They wouldnt even let us speak to a supervisor or manager Awful bordering on passenger abuse,Very Negative
1841,1841,0.12,0.843,0.037,-0.9583,  1 Ground crew in Heathrow left 60 passengers luggage We had 3 bags 2 The Heathrow ground crew left 1 of ours behind after the 1st two were received the next day 3 The Heathrow ground crew lost our 3rd bag 4 times and we were on the phone with them for over 3 hrs over the course of the week 4 Due to this we had to spend 500 on health and beauty items for my wife on our cruise 5 British Airways said they MIGHT reimburse after 3 months 6 We had to spend 100 in cab fare to Barcelona because the Bacelona ground crew Iberia claimed they had delivered it to us 7 Heathrow ground crew made us 15 minutes late arriving back into Heathrow after our cruise We actually landed 10 minutes early but those incompetent people still were not ready for us 8 The Heathrow ground crew caused us to leave 45 minutes late even though ALL passengers were boarded and ready 15 minutes before the departure time This will probably mean we will miss our connection in Anchorage BA clearly does not care or know how to operate a ground baseshameful BA is a joke and should be embarrassed they cant operate like a normal airline They do not grasp the concept that even a small hiccup can cause mass ripples of chaos to other people,Very Negative
1833,1833,0.1,0.834,0.066,-0.8042, 5 days before the flight we were advised by BA that it had been cancelled and asked us to rebook There were flights 1 hour before and 1 hour after our original flight but they made us take one 3 hours earlier Our original ticket and the return flight a week later included a checked bag When we arrive at Heathrow to check in we are told our ticket doesnt included a bag and we will have to pay 75 pounds each to take them We explained that the original ticket had the bags and when they checked the system they confirmed that it did but not this one They would make no effort to sort it out and just told us to pay up or they would remove us from the flight So we had no choice but to pay up thinking it should be pretty easy to get a refund 15 months and 10 emails later we have still not seen a penny Every time I ask where my refund is and state how long we have been waiting I get an inane email saying some departments take longer than others to respond  Absolutely hopeless airline to stuff up the booking in the first place and even worse customer service to not even attempt to solve the problem at check in even when they could see the mistake THEY had made in their system compounded by being be unable to investigate a very simple claim and refund me 150 pounds in 15 months,Very Negative
1831,1831,0.136,0.783,0.081,-0.85, I recently had a delay on British Airways from BRU to LHR that was due to staff shortages They announced that there was a 2 hour holding delay but they would board us immediately in hopes of clearing the gate and leaving early We had to wait the full 2 hours inside the airplane The plane was old dirty had no power at the seats The staff provided a small bag of pretzels and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight There were no options to purchase food or drink There were no entertainment options available I am a OneWorld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members based on status First class lounges at Heathrow are overcrowded understaffed and poorly equipped The help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations  even when having the top status The Avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket British has lost its way in recent years and has a moved from a worldclass airline to a budget airline with much worse service and timeliness than Ryanair or EasyJet,Very Negative
1830,1830,0.185,0.744,0.071,-0.9342, 4 Hours before takeoff we received a Mail stating a cryptic message that there are disruptions to be expected as there is a limit on how many planes can leave at the same time So did the capacity of the Heathrow Airport really hit British Airways by surprise 4h before departure Anyhow  we took the one hour delay so what  but then we have been forced to check in our Hand luggage I travel only with hand luggage to avoid waiting for the ultra slow processing of the checked in luggage Overall 2h later at home than planed with really no reason just due to incompetent people Service level far worse then Ryanair and triple the price Really never again Thanks for nothing,Very Negative
1828,1828,0.132,0.789,0.079,-0.9641,Dear Community I feel compelled to share the utter frustration and disappointment that defined my recent travel experience with British Airways Buckle up folks this ones a rollercoaster On July 16 and 17 2023 I had the displeasure of flying with British Airways on BA709 and BA7 and let me tell you it was a nightmare The initial flight from Zurich ZRH to London LHR on BA709 faced a seemingly unavoidable onehour delay upon arrival at LHR This of course resulted in me missing my connection to Tokyo triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to Tokyo HND via Beijing with Air China Oh but the fun didnt stop there — flight CA183 was also delayed turning my 16hour delay into a grand total of 23 hours finally arriving in Tokyo at 2300 instead of the promised 710 And the cherry on top My four checkedin suitcases decided to take a detour and didnt join me in Tokyo forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the baggage center I finally got my lost luggage back on July 23 because why make it easy right But wait theres more My return flight from Tokyo to Zurich BA8 on August 8 also danced to the delay tune making me question if punctuality is just a myth for British Airways The cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans stealing a whole day of scheduled activities including a guided Tokyo tour As if that werent enough I had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expenses—extra airport transfers tour operator assistance fees emergency purchases airport meals and international calls for rearrangements The lack of assistance at LHR airport was the icing on this bitter cake Installing the BA app just to get basic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle and the fact that no BA clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating British Airways youve left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet Heres hoping you take this feedback seriously and step up your game because right now its not a good look Frustrated and fed up Bert,Very Negative
1818,1818,0.131,0.853,0.016,-0.9465,Once again a terrible business class experience with BA The flight was delayed by 45 hours The plane was very old with problems with at least 4 of the seats in business class not cleaned properly prior to departure Food was terrible as always with BA and only one choice available from advertised menu As a result of the delay we missed our connecting flight from Heathrow and instead of putting us on the next connection they chose the second last flight of the day  which was also delayed by over an hour meaning we had an additional 4 hour delay whilst at Heathrow At no point were we advised about our compensation rights despite asking at check in and connections or provided any vouchers during the delays Having flown Etihad Qatar and Virgin business class equivalents over the last year it is clear to see how big the gulf now is between BA and its rivals ,Very Negative
1816,1816,0.149,0.819,0.031,-0.9751, I was going to fly to Frankfurt from Glasgow over London but the flight from London to Frankfurt was cancelled This meant I had to stay overnight in London where I have no accommodation etc As I was rebooked to a flight from London City airport which was more than 2h by train I had to get an uber and then take a hotel for £250 in total London prices I was reassured over the phone that I would get all the money back My flight from London city airport was then cancelled again and rebooked to London Heathrow but two days later I then cancelled that flight and rebooked a new one with Lufthansa as I urgently had to get to work and needed the money I never received the money back for the hotel compensation for cancelled flight 1 compensation for cancelled flight 2 the extra food I had to pay for the uber or the actual cost of the flight I was first transferred 3€ by British Airways They stopped replying to me and told me the issue was weather conditions although other nonBA flights were going I lost over £700 in total and never got compensated for the loss of a work day either It just really feels like they dont care about people Worst serviceairline ever,Very Negative
1812,1812,0.124,0.859,0.017,-0.9359,Not    Beware BA dont provide any refund due to a very serious medical reason My father was diagnosed with a severe heart defect a couple of weeks before his flight date and BA refused to give any refund as this was not a good enough reason We sent them a medical note from his doctor saying he is unfit to travel due to potential heart failure and needs to have heart surgery as soon as possible and the operator totally dismissed it They said only thing they can do is change the travel date within a year Heart surgery recovery takes months and its highly unlikely that he will be able to travel within the year meaning he would lose his ticket and money They said they cant do anything to help not even change the name on the ticket so someone else can use the tickets The most ridiculous thing Ive heard,Very Negative
3699,3699,0.143,0.845,0.012,-0.9313,     Chaos at Terminal 5 with BA cancellations and delays and staff give different reasons depending on who you ask 9 out 10 answers were lies Sadly BA airport standards at T5 are worse than ever and we are long past being able to use Covid as an excuse As a short haul club Europe trip I expect very little from BA any more and they barely even provide that with cutbacks during Covid that are now permanent If you can find an alternative carrier on the same route choose them rather than BA Sadly on my route BA have a monopoly ,Very Negative
