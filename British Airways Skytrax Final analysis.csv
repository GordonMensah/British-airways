1013,1013,0.061,0.813,0.126,0.9856, Check in was chaotic and badly organised Even though there were two desks one for premium and one economy there ended up being just one queue in front of the premium check in even though most passengers in it were economy That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers unnecessarily badly organised the staff in charge should be retrained Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines and it is actually quite good overall Nice layout and seating options reasonable food and drink options and an outdoor terrace which is really nice Boarding was very well organised although quite slow to get everyone on board but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards although as previously commented are really not very good overall the meal service was disappointing As is normal BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option  when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I’ve ever had in any cabin class rolling some mush similar consistency to mashed potato into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage BA you need to improve the meal options make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals  then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out Whilst I hadn’t planned on using it the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use Overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient I used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me,Positive,0.09246466118915099,0.5390323305945756
3355,3355,0.05,0.784,0.165,0.9879,  I am a frequent flyer with BA and have been for the last 15 years Having noted the ratings given frankly I cannot understand how BA scores three stars for most aspects of its service In a nutshell BA has placed profit margins over passenger appreciation This fact was hammered home on my return leg which was not in Club Europe Quite alarmingly BA appears to place profit over passenger safety by extending its Business Class seating up to and beyond emergency exit rows and then failing to ensure those seated in exit rows have the physical capacity to actually open the door incase of an emergency I was not at all reassured to see an elderly and slightly built woman seated with the responsibility of opening the overwing exit should the need have arisen Shorthaul business Club Europe is simply a joke and only useful for gaining valuable tier points for loungepreboarding benefits While cabin crew service is excellent the lack of space and reduction in refreshment choices etc places them a million airmiles behind competing airlines such as Qatar Turkish or Emirates who understand the true definition of customer appreciation and hospitality BA has consistently eroded the value of their Executive Club and seems to be of the impression that recent changes in obtaining avios points during the booking process benefit passengers  really I want to support BA and did enjoy flying with them up to the point when they started penny pinching and became more deserving of the name Budget Airways The attached photos taking during my most recent itinerary highlight the difference in customer careappreciation between British Airways and another airline used in this trip Both flights were around 4 hours in duration on the same day Guess which one is shows BAs inflight offering,Positive,0.16805555555555554,0.5779777777777778

3413,3413,0.061,0.813,0.126,0.9856, Check in was chaotic and badly organised Even though there were two desks one for premium and one economy there ended up being just one queue in front of the premium check in even though most passengers in it were economy That meant that those travelling in club or with higher status had no separate queue to join Whilst I was waiting in line another passenger went up to query and we ended up forming a new line in front of the economy check in desk for premium passengers unnecessarily badly organised the staff in charge should be retrained Security at the airport was very quick and through to the lounge This is a generic airport lounge for all airlines and it is actually quite good overall Nice layout and seating options reasonable food and drink options and an outdoor terrace which is really nice Boarding was very well organised although quite slow to get everyone on board but the flight was probably only half full and we still departed early so I think they felt no rush and it actually made the boarding experience nicer and more relaxed On board the club Europe seats are fine by European business standards although as previously commented are really not very good overall the meal service was disappointing As is normal BA do not stock enough of the proper meal option  when the options are so limited and varied in quality BA really should stock enough for everyone to have the good meal Sadly they had run out by the time they got to me so I had the option of vegetarian sausage or a salad I wanted a hot meal so went for the sausage and I can honestly say it was one of the most disgusting onboard meals I’ve ever had in any cabin class rolling some mush similar consistency to mashed potato into a sausage shape does not make it a sausage BA you need to improve the meal options make the vegetarian meal something you specifically have to request in advance and offer all passengers a choice of two decent meals  then people will not be left with such a substandard alternative when their first choice runs out Whilst I hadn’t planned on using it the on board WiFi was not functioning so was not available to use Overall though the flight was fairly comfortable and the cabin crew were very friendly and efficient I used avios to pay for the flight so it was obviously good value for money for me,Positive,0.09246466118915099,0.5390323305945756
850,850,0.024,0.901,0.076,0.8708,Not    I have flow on BA several times since the airline started nonstop service between Austin TX and London Heathrow Every year the service gets worse I brought a tape measure with me to see how far apart the seats are in the economy section 25½ inches BA has removed bathrooms in order to squeeze a few more rows of seats onto the aircraft Thankfully Im not a big person and was able to squeeze into my seat without being too uncomfortable When BA first started flying out of Austin the food was great Now when I arrive at Heathrow I get real food and take it on the plane with me I dont know where or who makes BAs food but it is not eatable If BA did not have a direct flight from my hometown to London I would fly with a different airline When we checked into Heathrow the line was extremely long and only one person was checking people in It took nearly an hour to get to the counter I understand airlines are making record profits and need to make up lost revenue from the pandemic but I think BA has gone too far and has little concern for customer service in pursuit of profits,Positive,0.11118421052631583,0.49099210526315795

1308,1308,0.069,0.803,0.128,0.9737,Absolutely pathetic business class product BA is not even remotely competitive with other International airlines in the business class market With old outdated 8 across seating  no I did not make a typing mistake  you either have to climb across someone or someone has to climb across you to gain aisle access The crew must also hate this layout since they have to reach through little window openings to provide service to passengers in the 2 center seats BA like most other Europeanbased airlines does not have a factual IntraEuropean business class product even though they promote  sell business class IntraEurope flights feature the same 33 seating throughout the aircraft  the only difference being the middle seat is left empty in business class  passengers get a meal  drinks but this does not justify the higher cost BAs TransAtlantic business class product is only slightly better because of the narrow 8 across seating The biggest surprise on both the LISLHR  LHRIAH flights was that BA has in fact substantially improved their food quality Shocking Unfortunately it is served in the WORST business class configurations of ANY International airline I have flown The entertainment  system  small screens  my laptop screen is twice the size  is like an airline offering 2 decades ago The flight crew was pleasant  perfunctory which is about the best one can expect from a BA crew BA will simply never match the quality of carriers like Singapore Emirates Qatar Etihad EVA ANA Japan Air New Zealand Qantas or many others BA can compete with USbased airlines like Delta American  United which are also not even in the same Universe in terms of a highquality business class product One of the biggest slaps in the face is that BA expects business class passengers to pay to select seats even though they have paid thousands of dollars to fly business class Several hundred US dollars for TransAtlantic flights Only if you wait until 24 hours before flight time are you allowed to select a seat at no cost Certainly another BA Management decision that was made without a functioning brain,Negative,-0.032042147667147684,0.4708289261664262

1816,1816,0.149,0.819,0.031,-0.9751, I was going to fly to Frankfurt from Glasgow over London but the flight from London to Frankfurt was cancelled This meant I had to stay overnight in London where I have no accommodation etc As I was rebooked to a flight from London City airport which was more than 2h by train I had to get an uber and then take a hotel for £250 in total London prices I was reassured over the phone that I would get all the money back My flight from London city airport was then cancelled again and rebooked to London Heathrow but two days later I then cancelled that flight and rebooked a new one with Lufthansa as I urgently had to get to work and needed the money I never received the money back for the hotel compensation for cancelled flight 1 compensation for cancelled flight 2 the extra food I had to pay for the uber or the actual cost of the flight I was first transferred 3€ by British Airways They stopped replying to me and told me the issue was weather conditions although other nonBA flights were going I lost over £700 in total and never got compensated for the loss of a work day either It just really feels like they dont care about people Worst serviceairline ever,Positive,0.050757575757575765,-0.4621712121212121
1812,1812,0.124,0.859,0.017,-0.9359,Not    Beware BA dont provide any refund due to a very serious medical reason My father was diagnosed with a severe heart defect a couple of weeks before his flight date and BA refused to give any refund as this was not a good enough reason We sent them a medical note from his doctor saying he is unfit to travel due to potential heart failure and needs to have heart surgery as soon as possible and the operator totally dismissed it They said only thing they can do is change the travel date within a year Heart surgery recovery takes months and its highly unlikely that he will be able to travel within the year meaning he would lose his ticket and money They said they cant do anything to help not even change the name on the ticket so someone else can use the tickets The most ridiculous thing Ive heard,Negative,-0.07395833333333332,-0.5049291666666667
